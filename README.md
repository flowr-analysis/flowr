_flowR_ is a sophisticated, static [dataflow analyzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-flow_analysis) for the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/).
It offers a wide variety of features, ranging from [program slicing](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Terminology#program-slice) over [code search](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Search-API) to [dependency analysis](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Query-API#dependencies-query).
