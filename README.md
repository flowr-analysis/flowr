_flowR_ is a static [dataflow analyzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-flow_analysis) for the [_R_](https://www.r-project.org/) programming language (tested for versions `4.x` and `3.6.x`)
It offers a wide variety of features, ranging from [program slicing](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Terminology#program-slice) to [dependency analysis](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Query-API#dependencies-query).

You can get and use _flowR_ as a [Visual Studio Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=code-inspect.vscode-flowr), 
[RStudio Addin](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/rstudio-addin-flowr), 
[R package](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr-r-adapter), and as a 
[Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/eagleoutice/flowr).

## ‚≠ê Getting Started

To get started with _flowR_ and its features, please check out the [Overview](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Overview) page. The [Setup](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Setup) wiki page explains how you can download and setup _flowR_ on your system. With docker&nbsp;üê≥Ô∏è, the following line should be enough (and drop you directly into the read-eval-print loop):

```shell
docker run -it --rm eagleoutice/flowr
```

You can enter `:help` to gain more information on its capabilities.
