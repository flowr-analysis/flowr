/**
 * The pipeline executor allows to execute arbitrary {@link Pipeline|pipelines} in a step-by-step fashion.
 * If you are not yet in the possession of a {@link Pipeline|pipeline}, you can use the {@link createPipeline} function
 * to create one for yourself, based on the steps that you want to execute.
 *
 * Those steps are split into two phases or "stages" (which is the name that we will use in the following), represented
 * by the {@link PipelineStepStage} type. These allow us to separate things that have to be done
 * once per-file, e.g., actually parsing the AST, from those, that we need to repeat 'once per request' (whatever this
 * request may be). In other words, what can be cached between operations and what can not.
 *
 * Furthermore, this executor follows an iterable fashion to be *as flexible as possible*
 * (e.g., to be instrumented with measurements). So, you can use the pipeline executor like this:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const stepper = new PipelineExecutor( ... )
 * while(stepper.hasNextStep()) {
 *     await stepper.nextStep()
 * }
 *
 * stepper.switchToRequestStage()
 *
 * while(stepper.hasNextStep()) {
 *     await stepper.nextStep()
 * }
 *
 * const result = stepper.getResults()
 * ```
 *
 * Of course, you might think, that this is rather overkill if you simply want to receive the result.
 * And this is true. Therefore, if you do not want to perform some kind of magic in-between steps, you can use the
 * **{@link allRemainingSteps}** function like this:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const stepper = new PipelineExecutor( ... )
 * const result = await stepper.allRemainingSteps()
 * ```
 *
 * As the name suggest, you can combine this name with previous calls to {@link nextStep} to only execute the remaining
 * steps in case, for whatever reason you only want to instrument some steps.
 *
 * By default, the {@link PipelineExecutor} does not offer an automatic way to repeat requests (mostly to prevent accidental errors).
 * However, you can use the
 * **{@link updateRequest}** function to reset the request steps and re-execute them for a new request. This allows something like the following:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const stepper = new PipelineExecutor( ... )
 * const result = await stepper.allRemainingSteps()
 *
 * stepper.updateRequest( ... )
 * const result2 = await stepper.allRemainingSteps()
 * ```
 *
 * **Example - Slicing With the Pipeline Executor**:
 *
 * Suppose, you want to... you know _slice_ a file (which was, at one point the origin of flowR), then you can
 * either create a pipeline yourself with the respective steps, or you can use the {@link DEFAULT_SLICING_PIPELINE} (and friends).
 * With it, slicing essentially becomes 'easy-as-pie':
 *
 * ```ts
 * const slicer = new PipelineExecutor(DEFAULT_SLICING_PIPELINE, {
 *    shell,
 *    // of course, the criterion and request given here are just examples, you can use whatever you want to slice!
 *    criterion: ['2@b'],
 *    request:   requestFromInput('b <- 3; x <- 5\ncat(b)'),
 * })
 * const result = await slicer.allRemainingSteps()
 * ```
 *
 * But now, we want to slice for `x` in the first line as well! We can do that by adding:
 *
 * ```ts
 * stepper.updateRequest({ criterion: ['1@x'] })
 * const result2 = await stepper.allRemainingSteps()
 * ```
 *
 * @note Even though using the pipeline executor introduces a small performance overhead, we consider
 * it to be the baseline for performance benchmarking. It may very well be possible to squeeze out a little bit more by
 * directly constructing the steps in the right order. However, we consider this to be negligible when compared with the time required
 * for, for example, the dataflow analysis of larger files.
