 *
 * 0) the collection of {@link IPipelineStep|steps} is not empty

 * 2) all {@link IPipelineStepOrder#dependencies|dependencies} of all {@link IPipelineStep|steps} are exist
 * 3) there are no cycles in the dependency graph
 * 4) the target of a {@link IPipelineStepOrder#decorates|step's decoration} exists
 * 5) if a {@link IPipelineStepOrder#decorates|decoration} applies, all of its {@link IPipelineStepOrder#dependencies|dependencies} are already in the pipeline
 * 6) in the resulting {@link Pipeline|pipeline}, there is a strict cut between {@link IPipelineStep|steps} that are executed
