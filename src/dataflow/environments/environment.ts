/**
 * An environment describes a ({@link IEnvironment#parent|scoped}) mapping of names to their definitions ({@link EnvironmentMemory}).
 *
 * First, yes, R stores its environments differently, potentially even with another differentiation between
 * the `baseenv`, the `emptyenv`, and other default environments (see https://adv-r.hadley.nz/environments.html).
 * Yet, during the dataflow analysis, we want sometimes to know more (static {@link IdentifierDefinition|reference information})
 * and sometimes know less (to be honest, we do not want that,
 * but statically determining all attached environments is theoretically impossible --- consider attachments by user input).
 *
 * One important environment is the {@link BuiltInEnvironment} which contains the default definitions for R's built-in functions and constants.
 * Please use {@link initializeCleanEnvironments} to initialize the environments (which includes the built-ins).
 * During serialization, you may want to rely on the {@link builtInEnvJsonReplacer} to avoid the huge built-in environment.
 *
 *
 * @see {@link define} - to define a new {@link IdentifierDefinition|identifier definition} within an environment
 * @see {@link resolveByName} - to resolve an {@link Identifier|identifier/name} to its {@link IdentifierDefinition|definitions} within an environment
 * @see {@link makeReferenceMaybe} - to attach control dependencies to a reference
 * @see {@link pushLocalEnvironment} - to create a new local scope
 * @see {@link popLocalEnvironment} - to remove the current local scope
