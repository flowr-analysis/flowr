/**
 * Each reference has exactly one reference type, stored as the respective number.
 * However, when checking, we may want to allow for one of several types,
 * allowing the combination of the respective bitmasks.
 *
 * Having reference types is important as R separates a variable definition from
 * a function when resolving an {@link Identifier|identifier}.
 * In `c <- 3; print(c(1, 2))` the call to `c` works normally (as the vector constructor),
 * while writing `c <- function(...) ..1` overshadows the built-in and causes `print` to only output the first element.
 *
 * @see {@link isReferenceType} - for checking if a (potentially joint) reference type contains a certain type
 * @see {@link ReferenceTypeReverseMapping} - for debugging
