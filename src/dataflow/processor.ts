 * Therefore, the dataflow processor has no complete control over the traversal and merge strategy of the graph, with each processor being in
 * the position to call the other processors as needed for its children.
 * <p>
 * Now this method can be called recursively within the other processors to parse the dataflow for nodes that you cannot narrow down
 * in type or context.
