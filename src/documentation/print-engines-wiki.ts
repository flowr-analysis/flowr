To analyze R scripts, flowR needs to parse the R code and for that, we require a parser.
Originally, flowR shipped with a ${shortLink(RShell.name, types.info)}, an asynchronous interface to the R interpreter, still available today.
Later we extended this with the ${shortLink(RShellExecutor.name, types.info)}, the synchronous counterpart to the ${shortLink(RShell.name, types.info)}.
However, these interfaces are relatively slow as they require communication with an underlying R interpreter. 
Using [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/), with its [node bindings](https://github.com/tree-sitter/node-tree-sitter)
and [R grammar](https://github.com/r-lib/tree-sitter-r), we can provide the ${shortLink(TreeSitterExecutor.name, types.info)} which
is synchronous, faster, and no longer needs an R installation, but requires the appropriate bindings.
To allow users of R to freely choose their backend between the R interpreter and the tree-sitter parser,
we provide the concept of engines. 

Engines can be loaded with [flowR's configuration file](${FlowrWikiBaseRef}/Interface#configuring-flowr). Additionally, they
are exposed with some command line options (e.g., when using the docker image of flowR):

- ${getCliLongOptionOf('flowr', 'engine.r-shell.disabled', false)} to disable the ${shortLink(RShell.name, types.info)} engine
- ${getCliLongOptionOf('flowr', 'engine.r-shell.r-path', false)} (which is the canonical version of ${getCliLongOptionOf('flowr', 'r-path')})
- ${getCliLongOptionOf('flowr', 'engine.tree-sitter.disabled', false)} to disable the ${shortLink(TreeSitterExecutor.name, types.info)} engine
- ${getCliLongOptionOf('flowr', 'engine.tree-sitter.lax', false)} to use lax parsing with tree-sitter
- ${getCliLongOptionOf('flowr', 'engine.tree-sitter.wasm-path', false)} pass the path to the wasm of the r grammar of tree-sitter (see [below](#tree-sitter))
- ${getCliLongOptionOf('flowr', 'engine.tree-sitter.tree-sitter-wasm-path', false)} pass the path to the wasm of tree-sitter (see [below](#tree-sitter))
- ${getCliLongOptionOf('flowr', 'default-engine', false)} to set the default engine to use

## Dealing with the Tree-Sitter Engine

${
	block({
		type:    'WARNING',
		content: 'As the tree-sitter engine is only for parsing, it cannot execute R code.'
	})
}

In general, there is no need for you to pass custom paths using either 
${getCliLongOptionOf('flowr', 'engine.tree-sitter.wasm-path', false)} or
${getCliLongOptionOf('flowr', 'engine.tree-sitter.tree-sitter-wasm-path', false)}.
However, you may want to experiment with the R grammar or provide a newer
one in case that of _flowR_ is outdated. 

To use a newer [R grammar](https://github.com/r-lib/tree-sitter-r),
you first must build the new wasm file. For this you have to:

1. Install the dependencies with \`npm ci\` in the tree-sitter-r repository.
2. Build the wasm using \`tree-sitter build --wasm .\` the [tree sitter cli](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter)
   which should be a dev dependency.
3. Pass the \`tree-sitter-r.wasm\` to flowR. 

For tree-sitter, please rely on the [releases](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/releases).
