As explained in the [Overview](${FlowrWikiBaseRef}/Overview), you can simply run the [TCP](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol)&nbsp;server by adding the ${getCliLongOptionOf('flowr', 'server', true)} flag (and, due to the interactive mode, exit with the conventional <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>).
Currently, every connection is handled by the same underlying \`${RShell.name}\` - so the server is not designed to handle many clients at a time.
Additionally, the server is not well guarded against attacks (e.g., you can theoretically spawn an arbitrary number of&nbsp;${RShell.name} sessions on the target machine).

Every message has to be given in a single line (i.e., without a newline in-between) and end with a newline character. Nevertheless, we will pretty-print example given in the following segments for the ease of reading.

${

The default ${getCliLongOptionOf('flowr', 'server', false)} uses a simple [TCP](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol)

### 📡 Ways of Connecting

If you are interested in clients that communicate with _flowR_, please check out the [R adapter](${FlowrGithubBaseRef}/flowr-r-adapter)
as well as the [Visual Studio Code extension](${FlowrGithubBaseRef}/vscode-flowr). 

<ol>

<li>
<a id="using-netcat-without-websocket"></a>Using Netcat

<details>

<summary>Without Websocket</summary>

Suppose, you want to launch the server using a docker container. Then, start the server by (forwarding the internal default port):

${codeBlock('shell', `docker run -p1042:1042 -it --rm ${DockerName} --server`)}

Now, using a tool like [_netcat_](https://linux.die.net/man/1/nc) to connect:

${codeBlock('shell', 'nc 127.0.0.1 1042')}

Within the started session, type the following message (as a single line) and press enter to see the response:

${codeBlock('json', removeRQuotes(JSON.stringify({ type: 'request-file-analysis', content: 'x <- 1', id: '1' } satisfies FileAnalysisRequestMessage)))}

</details>
</li>

<li> Using Python
<details>
<summary>Without Websocket</summary>

In Python, a similar process would look like this. After starting the server as with using [netcat](#using-netcat-without-websocket), you can use the following script to connect:

${codeBlock('python', `
import socket

with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:
    s.connect(('127.0.0.1', 1042))
    print(s.recv(4096))  # for the hello message

    s.send(b'${removeRQuotes(JSON.stringify({ type: 'request-file-analysis', content: 'x <- 1', id: '1' } satisfies FileAnalysisRequestMessage))}\\n')

    print(s.recv(65536))  # for the response (please use a more sophisticated mechanism)
`)}

</details>
</li>

</ol>

> [!NOTE]
> To execute arbitrary R commands with a repl request, _flowR_ has to be started explicitly with ${getCliLongOptionOf('flowr', 'r-session-access')}.
> Please be aware that this introduces a security risk and note that this relies on the [\`r-shell\` engine](${FlowrWikiBaseRef}/Engines).


Although primarily meant for users to explore, 
there is nothing which forbids simply calling _flowR_ as a subprocess to use standard-in, -output, and -error 
for communication (although you can access the REPL using the server as well, 
with the [REPL Request](#message-request-repl-execution) message).

The read-eval-print loop&nbsp;(REPL) works relatively simple.
You can submit an expression (using enter),
which is interpreted as an R&nbsp;expression by default but interpreted as a *command* if it starts with a colon (\`:\`).
The best command to get started with the REPL is ${getReplCommand('help')}.
Besides, you can leave the REPL either with the command ${getReplCommand('quit')} or by pressing <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> twice.


<details>
<summary>Available Commands</summary>

We currently offer the following commands (this with a \`[*]\` suffix are available with and without the star):

${printReplHelpAsMarkdownTable()}

</details>


### Example: Retrieving the Dataflow Graph

To retrieve a URL to the [mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) diagram of the dataflow of a given expression, 
use ${getReplCommand('dataflow*')} (or ${getReplCommand('dataflow')} to get the mermaid code in the cli):

${await documentReplSession(shell, [{
	command:     ':dataflow* y <- 1 + x',
	description: `Retrieve the dataflow graph of the expression \`y <- 1 + x\`. It looks like this:\n${await printDfGraphForCode(shell, 'y <- 1 + x')}`
}])}

For the slicing with ${getReplCommand('slicer')}, you have access to the same [magic comments](#slice-magic-comments) as with the [slice request](#message-request-slice).

### Example: Interfacing with the File System

Many commands that allow for an R-expression (like ${getReplCommand('dataflow*')}) allow for a file as well 
if the argument starts with \`${fileProtocol}\`. 
If you are working from the root directory of the _flowR_ repository, the following gives you the parsed AST of the example file using the ${getReplCommand('parse')} command:

${await documentReplSession(shell, [{
	command:     `:parse ${fileProtocol}test/testfiles/example.R`,
	description: `Retrieve the parsed AST of the example file.

<details>

<summary>File Content</summary>	

${codeBlock('r', getFileContentFromRoot('test/testfiles/example.R'))}

</details>

As _flowR_ directly transforms this AST the output focuses on being human-readable instead of being machine-readable. 
		`
}])}
`;
}

function explainConfigFile(): string {
	return `

When running _flowR_, you may want to specify some behaviors with a dedicated configuration file. 
By default, flowR looks for a file named \`${defaultConfigFile}\` in the current working directory (or any higher directory). 
You can also specify a different file with ${getCliLongOptionOf('flowr', 'config-file')} or pass the configuration inline using ${getCliLongOptionOf('flowr', 'config-json')}.
To inspect the current configuration, you can run flowr with the ${getCliLongOptionOf('flowr', 'verbose')} flag, or use the \`config\` [Query](${FlowrWikiBaseRef}/Query%20API).
Within the REPL this works by running the following:

${codeBlock('shell', ':query @config')}

The following summarizes the configuration options:

- \`ignoreSourceCalls\`: If set to \`true\`, _flowR_ will ignore source calls when analyzing the code, i.e., ignoring the inclusion of other files.
- \`semantics\`: allows to configure the way _flowR_ handles R, although we currently only support \`semantics/environment/overwriteBuiltIns\`. 
  You may use this to overwrite _flowR_'s handling of built-in function and even completely clear the preset definitions shipped with flowR. 
  See [Configure BuiltIn Semantics](#configure-builtin-semantics) for more information.
- \`solver\`: allows to configure how _flowR_ resolves variables and their values (currently we support: ${Object.values(VariableResolve).map(v => `\`${v}\``).join(', ')}), as well as if pointer analysis should be active.
- \`engines\`: allows to configure the engines used by _flowR_ to interact with R code. See the [Engines wiki page](${FlowrWikiBaseRef}/Engines) for more information.
- \`defaultEngine\`: allows to specify the default engine to use for interacting with R code. If not set, an arbitrary engine from the specified list will be used.

So you can configure _flowR_ by adding a file like the following:

<details>

<summary>Example Configuration File</summary>

${codeBlock('json', JSON.stringify(
		{
			ignoreSourceCalls: true,
			semantics:         {
				environment: {
					overwriteBuiltIns: {
						definitions: [
							{ type: 'function', names: ['foo'], processor: 'builtin:assignment', config: {} }
						]
					}
				}
			},
			engines: [{ type: 'r-shell' }],
			solver:  {
				variables:       VariableResolve.Alias,
				pointerTracking: true
			}
		} satisfies FlowrConfigOptions,
		null, 2))
}

</details>

<details> 
<a id='configure-builtin-semantics'></a>
<summary>Configure Built-In Semantics</summary> 


\`semantics/environment/overwriteBuiltins\` accepts two keys:

- \`loadDefaults\` (boolean, initially \`true\`): If set to \`true\`, the default built-in definitions are loaded before applying the custom definitions. Setting this flag to \`false\` explicitly disables the loading of the default definitions.
- \`definitions\` (array, initially empty): Allows to overwrite or define new built-in elements. Each object within must have a \`type\` which is one of the below. Furthermore, they may define a string array of \`names\` which specifies the identifiers to bind the definitions to. You may use \`assumePrimitive\` to specify whether _flowR_ should assume that this is a primitive non-library definition (so you probably just do not want to specify the key).

  | Type            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Example                                                                                                    |
  | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | \`constant\`    | Additionally allows for a \`value\` this should resolve to.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | \`{ type: 'constant', names: ['NULL', 'NA'],  value: null }\`                                                |
  | \`function\`    | Is a rather flexible way to define and bind built-in functions. For the time, we do not have extensive documentation to cover all the cases, so please either consult the sources with the \`default-builtin-config.ts\` or open a [new issue](${NewIssueUrl}). | \`{ type: 'function', names: ['next'], processor: 'builtin:default', config: { cfg: ExitPointType.Next } }\` |

_flowR_ can be used as a [module](${FlowrNpmRef}) and offers several main classes and interfaces that are interesting for extension writers 
(see the [Visual Studio Code extension](${FlowrGithubBaseRef}/vscode-flowr) or the [core](${FlowrWikiBaseRef}/Core) wiki page for more information).

### Using the ${shortLink(RShell.name, types.info)} to Interact with R

The ${shortLink(RShell.name, types.info)} class allows interfacing with the \`R\`&nbsp;ecosystem installed on the host system.
Please have a look at [flowR's engines](${FlowrWikiBaseRef}/Engines) for more information on alterantives (for example, the ${shortLink(TreeSitterExecutor.name, types.info)}).

${
	block({
		type:    'IMPORTANT',
		content: `
Each ${shortLink(RShell.name, types.info)} controls a new instance of the R&nbsp;interpreter, 
make sure to call ${codeInline(shortLink(RShell.name + '::' + shell.close.name, types.info, false, 'i') + '()')} when you are done.`
	})
}

You can start a new "session" simply by constructing a new object with ${codeInline('new ' + shortLink(RShell.name, types.info, false) + '()')}.

However, there are several options that may be of interest 
(e.g., to automatically revive the shell in case of errors or to control the name location of the R process on the system).

With a shell object (let's call it \`shell\`), you can execute R code by using ${shortLink(RShell.name + '::' + shell.sendCommand.name, types.info, true, 'i')}, 
for example ${codeInline('shell.' + shortLink(RShell.name + ':::' + shell.sendCommand.name, types.info, false) + '("1 + 1")')}. 
However, this does not return anything, so if you want to collect the output of your command, use
${shortLink(RShell.name + '::' + shell.sendCommandWithOutput.name, types.info, true, 'i')} instead.

Besides that, the command ${shortLink(RShell.name + '::' + shell.tryToInjectHomeLibPath.name, types.info)} may be of interest, as it enables all libraries available on the host system.

### The Pipeline Executor

Once, in the beginning, _flowR_ was meant to produce a dataflow graph merely to provide *program slices*. 
However, with continuous updates, the [dataflow graph](${FlowrWikiBaseRef}/Dataflow%20Graph) repeatedly proves to be the more interesting part.
With this, we restructured _flowR_'s originally *hardcoded* pipeline to be far more flexible. 
Now, it can be theoretically extended or replaced with arbitrary steps, optional steps, and what we call 'decorations' of these steps. 
In short, if you still "just want to slice" you can do it like this with the ${shortLink(PipelineExecutor.name, types.info)}:

${
	codeBlock('ts', `
const slicer = new ${PipelineExecutor.name}(DEFAULT_SLICING_PIPELINE, {
  parser:    new ${RShell.name}(),
  request:   ${requestFromInput.name}('x <- 1\\nx + 1'),
  criterion: ['2@x']
})
const slice = await slicer.allRemainingSteps()
// console.log(slice.reconstruct.code)
`)
}

${
	details('More Information', `

If you compare this, with what you would have done with the old (and removed) \`SteppingSlicer\`, 
this essentially just requires you to replace the \`SteppingSlicer\` with the ${shortLink(PipelineExecutor.name, types.info)}
and to pass the ${shortLink('DEFAULT_SLICING_PIPELINE', types.info)} as the first argument.
The ${shortLink(PipelineExecutor.name, types.info)}...

1. Provides structures to investigate the results of all intermediate steps
2. Can be executed step-by-step
3. Can repeat steps (e.g., to calculate multiple slices on the same input)

See the in-code documentation for more information.

	`)
}


### Generate Statistics


<details>

<summary>Adding a New Feature to Extract</summary>

In this example, we construct a new feature to extract, with the name "*example*".
Whenever this name appears, you may substitute this with whatever name fits your feature best (as long as the name is unique).

1. **Create a new file in \`src/statistics/features/supported\`**\\
   Create the file \`example.ts\`, and add its export to the \`index.ts\` file in the same directory (if not done automatically).

2. **Create the basic structure**\\
   To get a better feel of what a feature must have, let's look
   at the basic structure (of course, due to TypeScript syntax,
   there are other ways to achieve the same goal):

   \`\`\`ts
   const initialExampleInfo = {
       /* whatever start value is good for you */
       someCounter: 0
   }

   export type ExampleInfo = Writable<typeof initialExampleInfo>

   export const example: Feature<ExampleInfo> = {
    name:        'Example Feature',
    description: 'A longer example description',

    process(existing: ExampleInfo, input: FeatureProcessorInput): ExampleInfo {
      /* perform analysis on the input */
      return existing
    },

    initialValue: initialExampleInfo
   }
   \`\`\`

   The \`initialExampleInfo\` type holds the initial values for each counter that you want to maintain during the feature extraction (they will usually be initialized with 0). The resulting \`ExampleInfo\` type holds the structure of the data that is to be counted. Due to the vast amount of data processed, information like the name and location of a function call is not stored here, but instead written to disk (see below).

   Every new feature must be of the \`Feature<Info>\` type, with \`Info\` referring to a \`FeatureInfo\` (like \`ExampleInfo\` in this example). Next to a \`name\` and a \`description\`, each Feature must provide:

   - a processor that extracts the information from the input, adding it to the existing information.
   - a function returning the initial value of the information (in this case, \`initialExampleInfo\`).

3. **Add it to the feature-mapping**\\
   Now, in the \`feature.ts\` file in \`src/statistics/features\`, add your feature to the \`ALL_FEATURES\` object.

Now, we want to extract something. For the *example* feature created in the previous steps, we choose to count the amount of \`COMMENT\` tokens.
So we define a corresponding [XPath](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XPath) query:

\`\`\`ts
const commentQuery: Query = xpath.parse('//COMMENT')
\`\`\`

Within our feature's \`process\` function, running the query is as simple as:

\`\`\`ts
const comments = commentQuery.select({ node: input.parsedRAst })
\`\`\`

Now we could do a lot of further processing, but for simplicity, we only record every comment found this way:

\`\`\`ts
appendStatisticsFile(example.name, 'comments', comments, input.filepath)
\`\`\`

We use \`example.name\` to avoid duplication with the name that we’ve assigned to the feature. It corresponds to the name of the folder in the statistics output.
\`'comments'\` refers to a freely chosen (but unique) name, that will be used as the name for the output file within the folder. The \`comments\` variable holds the result of the query, which is an array of nodes. Finally, we pass the \`filepath\` of the file that was analyzed (if known), so that it can be added to the statistics file (as additional information).
