	type:             'active',
	shortDescription: 'Finds all calls in a set of files that matches specified criteria.',
	functionName:     executeCallContextQueries.name,

	buildExplanation: async(shell: RShell) => {
		return `
Call context queries can be used to identify calls to specific functions that match criteria of your interest.
For now, we support two criteria:

1. **Function Name** (\`callName\`): The function name is specified by a regular expression. This allows you to find all calls to functions that match a specific pattern. Please note, that if you do not use Regex-Anchors, the query will match any function name that contains the given pattern (you can set the \`callNameExact\` property to \`true\` to automatically add the \`^...$\` anchors).
2. **Call Targets**  (\`callTargets\`): This specifies to what the function call targets. For example, you may want to find all calls to a function that is not defined locally.

Besides this, we provide the following ways to automatically categorize and link identified invocations:

1. **Kind**         (\`kind\`): This is a general category that can be used to group calls together. For example, you may want to link all calls to \`plot\` to \`visualize\`.
2. **Subkind**      (\`subkind\`): This is used to uniquely identify the respective call type when grouping the output. For example, you may want to link all calls to \`ggplot\` to \`plot\`.
3. **Linked Calls** (\`linkTo\`): This links the current call to the last call of the given kind. This way, you can link a call like \`points\` to the latest graphics plot etc.
   For now, we _only_ offer support for linking to the last call, as the current flow dependency over-approximation is not stable.
4. **Aliases**      (\`includeAliases\`): Consider a case like \`f <- function_of_interest\`, do you want calls to \`f\` to be included in the results? There is probably no need to combine this with a global call target!

It's also possible to filter the results based on the following properties:

1. **File** (\`fileFilter\`): This allows you to filter the results based on the file in which the call is located. This can be useful if you are only interested in calls in, e.g., specific folders.
   The \`fileFilter\` property is an object made up of two properties:
     - **Filter** (\`filter\`): A regular expression that a node's file attribute must match to be considered.
     - **Include Undefined Files** (\`includeUndefinedFiles\`): If \`fileFilter\` is set, but a node's file attribute is not present, should we include it in the results? Defaults to \`true\`.

Re-using the example code from above, the following query attaches all calls to \`mean\` to the kind \`visualize\` and the subkind \`text\`,
all calls that start with \`read_\` to the kind \`input\` but only if they are not locally overwritten, and the subkind \`csv-file\`, and links all calls to \`points\` to the last call to \`plot\`:

${
	await showQuery(shell, exampleQueryCode, [
		{ type: 'call-context', callName: '^mean$', kind: 'visualize', subkind: 'text' },
		{
			type:        'call-context',
			callName:    '^read_',
			kind:        'input',
			subkind:     'csv-file',
			callTargets: CallTargets.OnlyGlobal
		},
		{
			type:     'call-context',
			callName: '^points$',
			kind:     'visualize',
			subkind:  'plot',
			linkTo:   { type: 'link-to-last-call', callName: '^plot$' }
		}
	], { showCode: false })
}

As you can see, all kinds and subkinds with the same name are grouped together.
Yet, re-stating common arguments and kinds may be cumbersome (although you can already use clever regex patterns).
See the ${linkToQueryOfName('compound')} for a way to structure your queries more compactly if you think it gets too verbose.

This query calculates the _lineage_ of a given slicing criterion. The lineage traces back all parts that the
respective variables stems from given the reads, definitions, and returns in the dataflow graph.

To understand this, let's start with a simple example query, to get the lineage of the second use of \`x\` in the following code:
${codeBlock('r', exampleCode)}
 
For this, we use the criterion \`2@x\` (which is the first use of \`x\` in the second line).

In this simple scenario, the _lineage_ is equivalent to the slice (and in-fact the complete code). 
In general the lineage is smaller and makes no guarantees on executability. 
It is just a quick and neither complete nor sound way to get information on where the variable originates from.

This query replaces the old [\`request-lineage\`](${FlowrWikiBaseRef}/Interface#message-request-lineage) message.

Clusters are to be interpreted as literal clusters on the graph traversing
edges in both directions. From this perspective, 
the code \`${exampleA}\` has one cluster (given that all code is related),

		return `
A compound query comes in use, whenever we want to state multiple queries of the same type with a set of common arguments.
It offers the following properties of interest:

1. **Query** (\`query\`): the type of the query that is to be combined.
2. **Common Arguments** (\`commonArguments\`): The arguments that are to be used as defaults for all queries (i.e., any argument the query may have).
3. **Arguments** (\`arguments\`): The other arguments for the individual queries that are to be combined.

For example, consider the following compound query that combines two call-context queries for \`mean\` and \`print\`, both of which are to be
assigned to the kind \`visualize\` and the subkind \`text\` (using the example code from above):

${
	await showQuery(shell, exampleQueryCode, [{
		type:            'compound',
		query:           'call-context',
		commonArguments: { kind: 'visualize', subkind: 'text' },
		arguments:       [
			{ callName: '^mean$' },
			{ callName: '^print$' }
		]
	}], { showCode: false })

Of course, in this specific scenario, the following query would be equivalent:

${
	await showQuery(shell, exampleQueryCode, [
		{ type: 'call-context', callName: '^(mean|print)$', kind: 'visualize', subkind: 'text' }
	], { showCode: false, collapseResult: true })
}

However, compound queries become more useful whenever common arguments can not be expressed as a union in one of their properties.
Additionally, you can still overwrite default arguments.
In the following, we (by default) want all calls to not resolve to a local definition, except for those to \`print\` for which we explicitly
want to resolve to a local definition:

${
	await showQuery(shell, exampleQueryCode, [{
		type:            'compound',
		query:           'call-context',
		commonArguments: { kind: 'visualize', subkind: 'text', callTargets: CallTargets.OnlyGlobal },
		arguments:       [
			{ callName: '^mean$' },
			{ callName: '^print$', callTargets: CallTargets.OnlyLocal }
		]
	}], { showCode: false })
}

Now, the results no longer contain calls to \`plot\` that are not defined locally.

		return `
To slice, _flowR_ needs one thing from you: a variable or a list of variables (function calls are supported to, referring to the anonymous
return of the call) that you want to slice the dataflow graph for. 
Given this, the slice is essentially the subpart of the program that may influence the value of the variables you are interested in.
To specify a variable of interest, you have to present flowR with a [slicing criterion](${FlowrWikiBaseRef}/Terminology#slicing-criterion) (or, respectively, an array of them).

To exemplify the capabilities, consider the following code:
${codeBlock('r', exampleCode)}
If you are interested in the parts required for the use of \`x\` in the last line, you can use the following query:

${
	await showQuery(shell, exampleCode, [{
		type:     'static-slice',
		criteria: ['3@x']
	}], { showCode: false })
}

In general, you may be uninterested in seeing the reconstructed version and want to save some computation time, for this,
you can use the \`noReconstruction\` flag.

		}], { showCode: false })

		return `
This query extracts all dependencies from an R script, using a combination of a ${linkToQueryOfName('call-context')}
and more advanced tracking in the [Dataflow Graph](${FlowrWikiBaseRef}/Dataflow%20Graph).  

In other words, if you have a script simply reading: \`${exampleCode}\`, the following query returns the loaded library:
${
	await showQuery(shell, exampleCode, [{
		type: 'dependencies'
	}], { showCode: false, collapseQuery: true })
}

Of course, this works for more complicated scripts too. The query offers information on the loaded _libraries_, _sourced_ files, data which is _read_ and data which is _written_.
For example, consider the following script:
${codeBlock('r', longerCode)}
The following query returns the dependencies of the script.
${
	await showQuery(shell, longerCode, [{
		type: 'dependencies'
	}], { showCode: false, collapseQuery: true, collapseResult: true })
}

Currently, the dependency extraction may fail as it is essentially a set of heuristics guessing the dependencies.
We welcome any feedback on this (consider opening a [new issue](${NewIssueUrl})).

In the meantime we offer several properties to overwrite the default behavior (e.g., function names that should be collected)

${
	await showQuery(shell, longerCode, [{
		type:                   'dependencies',

		readFunctions:          [],
		writeFunctions:         []

Here, \`resolveValue\` tells the dependency query to resolve the value of this argument in case it is not a constant.

## The Query Format

Queries are JSON arrays of query objects, each of which uses a \`type\` property to specify the query type.
In general, we separate two types of queries:

1. **Active Queries**: Are exactly what you would expect from a query (e.g., the ${linkToQueryOfName('call-context')}). They fetch information from the dataflow graph.
2. **Virtual Queries**: Are used to structure your queries (e.g., the ${linkToQueryOfName('compound')}).

We separate these from a concept perspective. 
For now, we support the following **active** queries (which we will refer to simply as a \`query\`):

${tocForQueryType('active')}

Similarly, we support the following **virtual** queries: 

${tocForQueryType('virtual')}

Although it is probably better to consult the detailed explanations below, if you want to have a look at the scehma, here is its description:

### Why Queries?

First, consider that you have a file like the following (of course, this is just a simple and artificial example):

\`\`\`r
${exampleQueryCode}
\`\`\`

<details> <summary>Dataflow Graph of the Example</summary>

${await printDfGraphForCode(shell, exampleQueryCode, { showCode: false })}

</details>

Additionally, consider that you are interested in all function calls which loads data with \`read_csv\`.
A simple \`regex\`-based query could look like this: \`^read_csv$\`.
However, this fails to incorporate
 
1. Syntax-based information (comments, strings, used as a variable, called as a higher-order function, ...)
2. Semantic information (e.g., \`read_csv\` is overwritten by a function with the same name)
3. Context information (e.g., calls like \`points\` may link to the current plot)

To solve this, flowR provides a query API which allows you to specify queries on the dataflow graph.
For the specific use-case stated, you could use the ${linkToQueryOfName('call-context')} to find all calls to \`read_csv\` which refer functions that are not overwritten.

Just as an example, the following ${linkToQueryOfName('call-context')} finds all calls to \`read_csv\` that are not overwritten:

${await showQuery(shell, exampleQueryCode, [{ type: 'call-context', callName: '^read_csv$', callTargets: CallTargets.OnlyGlobal, kind: 'input', subkind: 'csv-file' }], { showCode: false })}

${await explainQueries(shell, 'active')}

${await explainQueries(shell, 'virtual')}
