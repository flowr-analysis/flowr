Please do not edit this file/wiki page directly._

We are currently working on documenting the capabilities of the analyzer (with the plugins, their loading order, etc.). In general, the code documentation
starting with the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/flowr-analyzer.ts#L100"><code><span title="Central class for conducting analyses with FlowR. Use the FlowrAnalyzerBuilder to create a new instance.  If you want the original pattern of creating a pipeline and running all steps, you can still do this with FlowrAnalyzer#runFull .  To inspect the context of the analyzer, use FlowrAnalyzer#inspectContext (if you are a plugin and need to modify it, use FlowrAnalyzer#context instead).">FlowrAnalyzer</span></code></a> and the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/flowr-analyzer-builder.ts#L39"><code><span title="Builder for the FlowrAnalyzer , use it to configure all analysis aspects before creating the analyzer instance with .build() or .buildSync() .  You can add new files and folders to analyze using the constructor or the .add() method.">FlowrAnalyzerBuilder</span></code></a> 
should be the best starting point.
