<h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>

No matter whether you want to analyze a single R script, a couple of R notebooks, a complete project, or an R package,
your journey starts with the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/flowr-analyzer-builder.ts#L38"><code><span title="Builder for the FlowrAnalyzer , use it to configure all analysis aspects before creating the analyzer instance with .build() or .buildSync() . You can add new files and folders to analyze using the .addRequest() method on the resulting analyzer.">FlowrAnalyzerBuilder</span></code></a> (further described in [Builder Configuration](#builder-configuration) below).
This builder allows you to configure the analysis in many different ways, for example, by specifying which [plugins](#Plugins) to use or
what [engine](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Engines) to use for the analysis.

When building the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/flowr-analyzer.ts#L135"><code><span title="Central class for conducting analyses with FlowR. Use the FlowrAnalyzerBuilder to create a new instance. If you want the original pattern of creating a pipeline and running all steps, you can still do this with FlowrAnalyzer#runFull . To inspect the context of the analyzer, use FlowrAnalyzer#inspectContext (if you are a plugin and need to modify it, use FlowrAnalyzer#context instead).">FlowrAnalyzer</span></code></a> instance, the builder will take care to

* load the [requested plugins](#Plugins)
* setup an initial [context](#Context_Information)
* create a [cache](#Caching) for speeding up future analyses
* initialize the [engine](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Engines) (e.g., TreeSitter) if needed

The builder provides two methods for building the analyzer:

* <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/flowr-analyzer-builder.ts#L144"><code><span title="Create the FlowrAnalyzer instance using the given information. Please note that the only reason this is async is that if no parser is set, we need to retrieve the default engine instance which is an async operation. If you have already initialized the engine (e.g., with TreeSitterExecutor#initTreeSitter ), you can use the synchronous version FlowrAnalyzerBuilder#buildSync instead.">FlowrAnalyzerBuilder::<b>build</b></span></code></a>\
	for an asynchronous build process that also initializes the engine if needed
* <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/flowr-analyzer-builder.ts#L156"><code><span title="Synchronous version of FlowrAnalyzerBuilder#build , please only use this if you have set the parser using FlowrAnalyzerBuilder#setParser before, otherwise an error will be thrown.">FlowrAnalyzerBuilder::<b>buildSync</b></span></code></a>\
	for a synchronous build process,
	which requires that the engine (e.g., TreeSitter) has already been initialized before calling this method.
	Yet, as Engines only have to be initialized once per process, this method is often more convenient to use.

	For more information on how to configure the builder, please refer to the [Builder Configuration](#builder-configuration) section below.

	<h3 id="Overview_of_the_Analyzer">Overview of the Analyzer</h3>

Once you have created an analyzer instance, you can add R files, folders, or even entire projects for analysis using the
<a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/flowr-analyzer.ts#L178"><code>FlowrAnalyzer::<b>addRequest</b></code></a> method.
All loaded [plugins](#Plugins) will be applied fully automatically during the analysis.
Please note that adding new files _after_ you already requested analysis results may cause bigger invalidations and cause re-analysis of previously analyzed files.
With the [files context](#Files_Context), you can also add virtual files to the analysis to consider, or *overwrite* existing files with modified content.
For this, have a look at the
<a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/flowr-analyzer.ts#L194"><code>FlowrAnalyzer::<b>addFile</b></code></a> method.

	
> [!NOTE]
> If you want to quickly try out the analyzer, you can use the following code snippet that analyzes a simple R expression:
> 
> 
> ```ts
> const analyzer = await new FlowrAnalyzerBuilder()
>     .setEngine('tree-sitter')
>     .build();
> // register a simple inline text-file for analysis
> analyzer.addRequest('x <- 1; print(x)');
> // get the dataflow
> const df = await analyzer.dataflow();
> // obtain the identified loading order
> console.log(analyzer.inspectContext().files.loadingOrder.getLoadingOrder());
> // run a dependency query
> const results = await analyzer.query([{ type: 'dependencies' }]);
> ```
> 
> 


To reset the analysis (e.g., to provide new requests) you can use <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/flowr-analyzer.ts#L173"><code>FlowrAnalyzer::<b>reset</b></code></a>.
If you need to pre-compute analysis results (e.g., to speed up future queries), you can use <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/flowr-analyzer.ts#L240"><code>FlowrAnalyzer::<b>runFull</b></code></a>.

<h3 id="Conducting_Analyses">Conducting Analyses</h3>

Please make sure to add all of the files, folder, and projects you want to analyze using the
<a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/flowr-analyzer.ts#L178"><code>FlowrAnalyzer::<b>addRequest</b></code></a> method (or <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/flowr-analyzer.ts#L194"><code>FlowrAnalyzer::<b>addFile</b></code></a> for virtual files).
Afterwards, you can request different kinds of analysis results, such as:

* <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/flowr-analyzer.ts#L216"><code>FlowrAnalyzer::<b>parse</b></code></a> to get the parsed information by the respective [engine](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Engines)\
You can also use <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/flowr-analyzer.ts#L220"><code>FlowrAnalyzer::<i>peekParse</i></code></a> to inspect the parse information if it was already computed (but without triggering a computation).
With <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/flowr-analyzer.ts#L164"><code>FlowrAnalyzer::<i>parserInformation</i></code></a>, you get additional information on the parser used for the analysis.
* <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/flowr-analyzer.ts#L224"><code>FlowrAnalyzer::<b>normalize</b></code></a> to compute the [Normalized AST](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Normalized%20AST)\
Likewise, <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/flowr-analyzer.ts#L228"><code>FlowrAnalyzer::<i>peekNormalize</i></code></a> returns the normalized AST if it was already computed but without triggering a computation.
* <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/flowr-analyzer.ts#L232"><code>FlowrAnalyzer::<b>dataflow</b></code></a> to compute the [Dataflow Graph](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Dataflow%20Graph)\
Again, <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/flowr-analyzer.ts#L236"><code>FlowrAnalyzer::<i>peekDataflow</i></code></a> allows you to inspect the dataflow graph if it was already computed (but without triggering a computation).
* <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/flowr-analyzer.ts#L245"><code>FlowrAnalyzer::<b>controlflow</b></code></a> to compute the [Control Flow Graph](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Control%20Flow%20Graph)\
Also, <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/flowr-analyzer.ts#L249"><code>FlowrAnalyzer::<i>peekControlflow</i></code></a> returns the control flow graph if it was already computed but without triggering a computation.
* <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/flowr-analyzer.ts#L253"><code>FlowrAnalyzer::<b>query</b></code></a> to run [queries](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Query-API) on the analyzed code.
* <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/flowr-analyzer.ts#L259"><code>FlowrAnalyzer::<b>runSearch</b></code></a> to run a search query on the analyzed code using the [search API](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Search%20API)

We work on providing a set of example repositories that demonstrate how to use the analyzer in different scenarios:

* [flowr-analysis/sample-analyzer-project-query](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/sample-analyzer-project-query) for an example project that runs queries on an R project
* [flowr-analysis/sample-analyzer-df-diff](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/sample-analyzer-df-diff) for an example project that compares dataflows graphs

<h2 id="Builder_Configuration">Builder Configuration</h2>

If you are interested in all available options, have a look at the [Builder Reference](#builder-reference) below.
The following sections highlight some of the most important configuration options:

1. How to [configure flowR](#configuring-flowr)
1. How to [configure the engine](#configuring-the-engine)
2. How to [register plugins](#configuring-plugins)

<h3 id="Configuring_flowR">Configuring flowR</h3>

You can fundamentally change the behavior of flowR using the [config file](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Interface#configuring-flowr),
embedded in the interface <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/config.ts#L92"><code>FlowrConfigOptions</code></a>.
With the builder you can either provide a complete configuration or amend the default configuration using:

* <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/flowr-analyzer-builder.ts#L73"><code><span title="Overwrite the configuration used by the resulting analyzer.">FlowrAnalyzerBuilder::<b>setConfig</b></span></code></a> to set a complete configuration
* <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/flowr-analyzer-builder.ts#L64"><code><span title="Apply an amendment to the configuration the builder currently holds. Per default, the defaultConfigOptions are used.">FlowrAnalyzerBuilder::<b>amendConfig</b></span></code></a> to amend the default configuration

By default, the builder uses flowR's standard configuration obtained with <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/config.ts#L230"><code>defaultConfigOptions</code></a>.


> [!NOTE]
> During the analysis with the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/flowr-analyzer.ts#L135"><code><span title="Central class for conducting analyses with FlowR. Use the FlowrAnalyzerBuilder to create a new instance. If you want the original pattern of creating a pipeline and running all steps, you can still do this with FlowrAnalyzer#runFull . To inspect the context of the analyzer, use FlowrAnalyzer#inspectContext (if you are a plugin and need to modify it, use FlowrAnalyzer#context instead).">FlowrAnalyzer</span></code></a>, you can also access the configuration with

Have a look at the attributes and layers listed below (e.g., files and deps ) to get an idea of the capabilities provided by this context. Besides these, this layer only orchestrates the different steps and layers, providing a collection of convenience methods alongside the resolvePreAnalysis method that conducts all the steps th...">FlowrAnalyzerContext</span></code></a>.


<h3 id="Configuring_the_Engine">Configuring the Engine</h3>

FlowR supports multiple [engines](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Engines) for parsing and analyzing R code.
With the builder, you can select the engine to use with:

* <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/flowr-analyzer-builder.ts#L92"><code><span title="Set the engine and hence the parser that will be used by the analyzer. This is an alternative to FlowrAnalyzerBuilder#setParser if you do not have a parser instance at hand.">FlowrAnalyzerBuilder::<b>setEngine</b></span></code></a> to set the desired engine.
* <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/flowr-analyzer-builder.ts#L83"><code><span title="Set the parser instance used by the analyzer. This is an alternative to FlowrAnalyzerBuilder#setEngine if you already have a parser instance. Please be aware, that if you want to parallelize multiple analyzers, there should be separate parser instances.">FlowrAnalyzerBuilder::<b>setParser</b></span></code></a> to set a specific parser implementation.

By default, the builder uses the TreeSitter engine with the TreeSitter parser.
The builder also takes care to initialize the engine if needed during the asynchronous build process
with <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/flowr-analyzer-builder.ts#L144"><code><span title="Create the FlowrAnalyzer instance using the given information. Please note that the only reason this is async is that if no parser is set, we need to retrieve the default engine instance which is an async operation. If you have already initialized the engine (e.g., with TreeSitterExecutor#initTreeSitter ), you can use the synchronous version FlowrAnalyzerBuilder#buildSync instead.">FlowrAnalyzerBuilder::<b>build</b></span></code></a>.
If you want to use the synchronous build process with <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/flowr-analyzer-builder.ts#L156"><code><span title="Synchronous version of FlowrAnalyzerBuilder#build , please only use this if you have set the parser using FlowrAnalyzerBuilder#setParser before, otherwise an error will be thrown.">FlowrAnalyzerBuilder::<b>buildSync</b></span></code></a>,
please ensure that the engine has already been initialized before calling this method.

<h3 id="Configuring_Plugins">Configuring Plugins</h3>

There are various ways for you to register plugins with the builder, exemplified by the following snippet
relying on the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/flowr-analyzer-builder.ts#L113"><code><span title="Register one or multiple additional plugins. For the default plugin set, please refer to FlowrAnalyzerPluginDefaults , they can be registered by passing true to the FlowrAnalyzerBuilder constructor.">FlowrAnalyzerBuilder::<b>registerPlugins</b></span></code></a> method:


```ts
const analyzer = await new FlowrAnalyzerBuilder(false)
    .registerPlugins(
        'file:description',
        new FlowrAnalyzerQmdFilePlugin(),
        ['file:rmd', [/.*.rmd/i]]
    )
    .build();
```


This indicates three ways to add a new plugin:

1. By using a predefined name (e.g., `file:description` for the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/plugins/file-plugins/flowr-analyzer-description-file-plugin.ts#L17"><code><span title="This plugin provides support for R DESCRIPTION files.">FlowrAnalyzerDescriptionFilePlugin</span></code></a>)\
   These mappings are controlled by the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/plugins/plugin-registry.ts#L46"><code><span title="Register a new Flowr Analyzer plugin for the registry, to be used by the FlowrAnalyzerBuilder and FlowrAnalyzer .">registerPluginMaker</span></code></a> function in the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/plugins/plugin-registry.ts#L38"><code><span title="The registry of built-in and user-registered Flowr Analyzer plugins. Used by the FlowrAnalyzerBuilder and FlowrAnalyzer to instantiate plugins by name.">PluginRegistry</span></code></a>.
   Under the hood, this relies on <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/plugins/plugin-registry.ts#L75"><code><span title="Create a Flowr Analyzer plugin from a PluginToRegister specification.">makePlugin</span></code></a> to create the plugin instance from the name.
2. By providing an already instantiated plugin (e.g., the new <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/plugins/file-plugins/notebooks/flowr-analyzer-qmd-file-plugin.ts#L14"><code><span title="The plugin provides support for Quarto R Markdown (.qmd) files">FlowrAnalyzerQmdFilePlugin</span></code></a> instance).\
   You can pass these by reference, instantiating any class that conforms to the [plugin specification](#Plugins).
3. By providing a tuple of the plugin name and its constructor arguments (e.g., `['file:rmd', [/.*.rmd/i]]` for the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/plugins/file-plugins/notebooks/flowr-analyzer-rmd-file-plugin.ts#L15"><code><span title="The plugin provides support for R Markdown (.rmd) files">FlowrAnalyzerRmdFilePlugin</span></code></a>).\
   This will also use the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/plugins/plugin-registry.ts#L75"><code><span title="Create a Flowr Analyzer plugin from a PluginToRegister specification.">makePlugin</span></code></a> function under the hood to create the plugin instance.

Please note, that by passing `false` to the builder constructor, no default plugins (see <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/plugins/flowr-analyzer-plugin-defaults.ts#L18"><code><span title="Provides the default set of Flowr Analyzer plugins.">FlowrAnalyzerPluginDefaults</span></code></a>) are registered (otherwise, all of the plugins in the example above would be registered by default).
If you want to unregister specific plugins, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/flowr-analyzer-builder.ts#L127"><code><span title="Remove one or multiple plugins.">FlowrAnalyzerBuilder::<b>unregisterPlugins</b></span></code></a> method.


> [!NOTE]
> If you directly access the API, please prefer creating the objects yourself by instantiating the respective classes instead of relying on the plugin registry.
> This avoids the indirection *and* potential issues with naming collisions in the registry.
> Moreover, this allows you to directly provide custom configuration to the plugin constructors in a readable fashion,
> *and* to re-use plugin instances.
> Instantiation by text is mostly for serialized communications (e.g., via a CLI or config format).


For more information on the different plugin types and how to create new plugins, please refer to the [Plugins](#Plugins) section below.

<h3 id="Builder_Reference">Builder Reference</h3>

The builder provides a plethora of methods to configure the resulting analyzer instance:

- <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/flowr-analyzer-builder.ts#L64"><code><span title="Apply an amendment to the configuration the builder currently holds.

Remove one or multiple plugins.

To build the analyzer after you have configured the builder, you can use one of the following:

- <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/flowr-analyzer-builder.ts#L144"><code><span title="Create the FlowrAnalyzer instance using the given information. Please note that the only reason this is async is that if no parser is set, we need to retrieve the default engine instance which is an async operation.

<code>FlowrAnalyzer</code>
instance using the given information.
Please note that the only reason this is `async` is that if no parser is set,
we need to retrieve the default engine instance which is an async operation.
If you have already initialized the engine (e.g., with
<code>TreeSitterExecutor#initTreeSitter</code>
),
you can use the synchronous version
<code>FlowrAnalyzerBuilder#buildSync</code>
instead.
- <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/flowr-analyzer-builder.ts#L156"><code><span title="Synchronous version of FlowrAnalyzerBuilder#build , please only use this if you have set the parser using FlowrAnalyzerBuilder#setParser before, otherwise an error will be thrown.">FlowrAnalyzerBuilder::<b>buildSync</b></span></code></a>\

<code>FlowrAnalyzerBuilder#build</code>
, please only use this if you have set the parser using
<code>FlowrAnalyzerBuilder#setParser</code>
before, otherwise an error will be thrown.

<h2 id="Plugins">Plugins</h2>

Plugins allow you to extend the capabilities of the analyzer in many different ways.
For example, they can be used to support other file formats, or to provide new algorithms to determine the loading order of files in a project.
All plugins have to extend the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/plugins/flowr-analyzer-plugin.ts#L87"><code><span title="The base class every plugin to be used with the FlowrAnalyzer must extend. **Please do not create plugins directly based on this class, but use the classes referenced alongside the PluginType values!* For example, if you want to create a plugin that determines the loading order of files, extend FlowrAnalyzerLoadingOrderPlugin instead. These classes also provide sensible overrides of FlowrAnalyzerP...">FlowrAnalyzerPlugin</span></code></a> base class and specify their <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/plugins/flowr-analyzer-plugin.ts#L28"><code><span title="Based on *when* and *what-for* the plugin is applied during the analysis, plugins are categorized into different types.

During the analysis, the analyzer will apply all registered plugins of the different types at the appropriate stages of the analysis.
If you just want to _use_ these plugins, you can usually ignore their [type](#plugin-types) and just register them with the builder as described 
in the [Builder Configuration](#builder-configuration) section above.
However, if you want to _create_ new plugins, you should be aware of the different plugin types and when they are applied during the analysis.

Currently, flowR supports the following plugin types built-in:

| Name | Class | Type | Description |
|------|-------|------|-------------|
| <code>file:description</code> | <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/plugins/file-plugins/flowr-analyzer-description-file-plugin.ts#L17"><code><span title="This plugin provides support for R DESCRIPTION files.">FlowrAnalyzerDescriptionFilePlugin</span></code></a> |  file-load | This plugin provides support for R `DESCRIPTION` files. |

```

Please note, that every plugin type has a default implementation (e.g., see <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/plugins/flowr-analyzer-plugin.ts#L96"><code><span title="Returns a default/dummy implementation to be used when no plugin of this type is registered or triggered.">defaultPlugin</span></code></a>)
that is always active.
We describe the different plugin types in more detail below.

<h4 id="Project_Discovery">Project Discovery</h4>

These plugins trigger when confronted with a project analysis request (see, <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/context/flowr-analyzer-files-context.ts#L29"><code><span title="This is a request to process a folder as a project, which will be expanded by the registered FlowrAnalyzerProjectDiscoveryPlugin s.">RProjectAnalysisRequest</span></code></a>).
Their job is to identify the files that belong to the project and add them to the analysis.
flowR provides the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/plugins/project-discovery/flowr-analyzer-project-discovery-plugin.ts#L16"><code><span title="This is the base class for all plugins that discover files in a project for analysis.

Please note that all project discovery plugins should conform to the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/plugins/project-discovery/flowr-analyzer-project-discovery-plugin.ts#L16"><code><span title="This is the base class for all plugins that discover files in a project for analysis.

In general, these plugins only trigger for a RProjectAnalysisRequest with the idea to discover all files in a projec...">FlowrAnalyzerProjectDiscoveryPlugin</span></code></a> base class.

<h4 id="File_Loading">File Loading</h4>

These plugins register for every file encountered by the [files context](#Files_Context) and determine whether and _how_ they can process the file.
They are responsible for transforming the raw file content into a representation that flowR can work with during the analysis.
For example, the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/plugins/file-plugins/flowr-analyzer-description-file-plugin.ts#L17"><code><span title="This plugin provides support for R DESCRIPTION files.">FlowrAnalyzerDescriptionFilePlugin</span></code></a> adds support for R `DESCRIPTION` files by parsing their content into key-value pairs.
These can then be used by other plugins, e.g. the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/plugins/package-version-plugins/flowr-analyzer-package-versions-description-file-plugin.ts#L18"><code><span title="This plugin extracts package versions from R DESCRIPTION files. It looks at the Depends and Imports fields to find package names and their version constraints.">FlowrAnalyzerPackageVersionsDescriptionFilePlugin</span></code></a> that extracts package version information from these files.

If multiple file plugins could apply (<a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/plugins/file-plugins/flowr-analyzer-file-plugin.ts#L36"><code>DefaultFlowrAnalyzerFilePlugin::<b>applies</b></code></a>) to the same file,
the loading order of these plugins determines which plugin gets to process the file.
Please ensure that no two file plugins _apply_ to the same file,
as this could lead to unexpected behavior.
Also, make sure that all file plugins conform to the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/plugins/file-plugins/flowr-analyzer-file-plugin.ts#L18"><code><span title="This is the base class for all plugins that load and possibly transform files when they are loaded. Different from other plugins, these plugins trigger for each file that is loaded (if they applies to the file). See the FlowrAnalyzer.addFile for more information on how files are loaded and managed. It is up to the construction to ensure that no two file plugins applies to the same file, otherwise,...">FlowrAnalyzerFilePlugin</span></code></a> base class.

<h4 id="Dependency_Identification">Dependency Identification</h4>

These plugins should identify which R packages are required with which versions for the analysis.
This information is then used to setup the R environment for the analysis correctly.
For example, the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/plugins/package-version-plugins/flowr-analyzer-package-versions-description-file-plugin.ts#L18"><code><span title="This plugin extracts package versions from R DESCRIPTION files. It looks at the Depends and Imports fields to find package names and their version constraints.">FlowrAnalyzerPackageVersionsDescriptionFilePlugin</span></code></a> extracts package version information from `DESCRIPTION` files
to identify the required packages and their versions.

All dependency identification plugins should conform to the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/plugins/package-version-plugins/flowr-analyzer-package-versions-plugin.ts#L9"><code><span title="This is the base class for all plugins that identify package and dependency versions used in the project. These plugins interplay with the FlowrAnalyzerDependenciesContext to gather information about the packages used in the project. See DefaultFlowrAnalyzerPackageVersionsPlugin for the no-op default implementation.">FlowrAnalyzerPackageVersionsPlugin</span></code></a> base class.

<h4 id="Loading_Order">Loading Order</h4>

These plugins determine the order in which files are loaded and analyzed.
This is crucial for correctly understanding the dependencies between files and improved analyses, especially in larger projects.
For example, the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/plugins/loading-order-plugins/flowr-analyzer-loading-order-description-file-plugin.ts#L15"><code><span title="This plugin extracts loading order information from R DESCRIPTION files. It looks at the Collate field to determine the order in which files should be loaded. If no Collate field is present, it does nothing.">FlowrAnalyzerLoadingOrderDescriptionFilePlugin</span></code></a> provides a basic implementation that orders files based on
the specification in a `DESCRIPTION` file, if present.

All loading order plugins should conform to the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/plugins/loading-order-plugins/flowr-analyzer-loading-order-plugin.ts#L12"><code><span title="This is the base class for all plugins that determine the loading order of files in a project. These plugins interplay with the FlowrAnalyzerFilesContext to gather information about the files in the project and determine their loading order. See DefaultFlowrAnalyzerLoadingOrderPlugin for the dummy default implementation. In general, these plugins only trigger for a full project analysis after all ...">FlowrAnalyzerLoadingOrderPlugin</span></code></a> base class.

<h3 id="How_to_add_a_new_plugin">How to add a new plugin</h3>

If you want to make a new plugin you first have to decide which type of plugin you want to create (see [Plugin Types](#plugin-types) above).
Then, you must create a new class that extends the corresponding base class (e.g., <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/plugins/file-plugins/flowr-analyzer-file-plugin.ts#L18"><code><span title="This is the base class for all plugins that load and possibly transform files when they are loaded. Different from other plugins, these plugins trigger for each file that is loaded (if they applies to the file). See the FlowrAnalyzer.addFile for more information on how files are loaded and managed. It is up to the construction to ensure that no two file plugins applies to the same file, otherwise,...">FlowrAnalyzerFilePlugin</span></code></a> for file loading plugins).
In general, most plugins operate on the [context information](#Context_Information) provided by the analyzer.
Usually it is a good idea to have a look at the existing plugins of the same type to get an idea of how to implement your own plugin.

Once you have your plugin you should register it with a sensible name using the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/plugins/plugin-registry.ts#L46"><code><span title="Register a new Flowr Analyzer plugin for the registry, to be used by the FlowrAnalyzerBuilder and FlowrAnalyzer .">registerPluginMaker</span></code></a> function.
This will allow users to register your plugin easily by name using the builder's <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/flowr-analyzer-builder.ts#L113"><code><span title="Register one or multiple additional plugins. For the default plugin set, please refer to FlowrAnalyzerPluginDefaults , they can be registered by passing true to the FlowrAnalyzerBuilder constructor.">FlowrAnalyzerBuilder::<b>registerPlugins</b></span></code></a> method.
Otherwise, users will have to provide an instance of your plugin class directly.

<h2 id="Context_Information">Context Information</h2>

The <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/flowr-analyzer.ts#L135"><code><span title="Central class for conducting analyses with FlowR. Use the FlowrAnalyzerBuilder to create a new instance. If you want the original pattern of creating a pipeline and running all steps, you can still do this with FlowrAnalyzer#runFull . To inspect the context of the analyzer, use FlowrAnalyzer#inspectContext (if you are a plugin and need to modify it, use FlowrAnalyzer#context instead).">FlowrAnalyzer</span></code></a> provides various context information during the analysis.
You can access the context with <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/flowr-analyzer.ts#L169"><code>FlowrAnalyzer::<b>inspectContext</b></code></a>
to receive a read-only view of the current analysis context.
Likewise, you can use <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/context/flowr-analyzer-context.ts#L114"><code><span title="Get a read-only version of this context. This is useful if you want to pass the context to a place where you do not want it to be modified or just to reduce the available methods.">FlowrAnalyzerContext::<b>inspect</b></span></code></a> to get a read-only view of a given context.
These read-only views prevent you from accidentally modifying the context during the analysis which may cause inconsistencies (this should be done either by
wrapping methods or by [plugins](#Plugins)).
The context is divided into multiple sub-contexts, each responsible for a specific aspect of the analysis.
These sub-contexts are described in more detail below.

For the general structure from an implementation perspective, please have a look at <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/context/flowr-analyzer-context.ts#L73"><code><span title="This summarizes the other context layers used by the FlowrAnalyzer . Have a look at the attributes and layers listed below (e.g., files and deps ) to get an idea of the capabilities provided by this context.

> [!TIP]

If for whatever reason you need to reset the context during an analysis, you can use
<a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/context/flowr-analyzer-context.ts#L121"><code><span title="Reset the context to its initial state, removing all files, dependencies, and loading orders.">FlowrAnalyzerContext::<b>reset</b></span></code></a>.
To pre-compute all possible information in the context before starting the main analysis, you can use
<a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/context/flowr-analyzer-context.ts#L104"><code><span title="this conducts all the step that can be done before the main analysis run">FlowrAnalyzerContext::<b>resolvePreAnalysis</b></span></code></a>.

<h3 id="Files_Context">Files Context</h3>

First, let's have look at the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/context/flowr-analyzer-files-context.ts#L121"><code><span title="This is the analyzer file context to be modified by all plugins that affect the files. If you are interested in inspecting these files, refer to ReadOnlyFlowrAnalyzerFilesContext . Plugins, however, can use this context directly to modify files.">FlowrAnalyzerFilesContext</span></code></a>  class that provides access to the files to be analyzed and their [loading order](#Loading_Order_Context):

   This is the analyzer file context to be modified by all plugins that affect the files.
   If you are interested in inspecting these files, refer to

   * **[ReadOnlyFlowrAnalyzerFilesContext](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/context/flowr-analyzer-files-context.ts#L64)**   
     This is the read-only interface for the files context, which is used to manage all files known to the
     <code>FlowrAnalyzer</code>
     .
     It prevents you from modifying the available files, but allows you to inspect them (which is probably what you want when using the
     <code>FlowrAnalyzer</code>
     ).
     If you are a
     <code>FlowrAnalyzerProjectDiscoveryPlugin</code>
     and want to modify the available files, you can use the

It also provides methods to check for whether a file exists (e.g., <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/context/flowr-analyzer-files-context.ts#L230"><code>FlowrAnalyzerFilesContext::<i>hasFile</i></code></a>,
<a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/context/flowr-analyzer-files-context.ts#L237"><code>FlowrAnalyzerFilesContext::<i>exists</i></code></a>)

Using the available [plugins](#Plugins), the loading order context determines the order in which files are loaded and analyzed by flowR's analyzer.
You can inspect the identified loading order using
<a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/context/flowr-analyzer-loading-order-context.ts#L136"><code>FlowrAnalyzerLoadingOrderContext::<i>getLoadingOrder</i></code></a>.
If there are multiple possible loading orders (e.g., due to circular dependencies),
you can use <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/context/flowr-analyzer-loading-order-context.ts#L120"><code>FlowrAnalyzerLoadingOrderContext::<i>currentGuesses</i></code></a>.

<h2 id="Caching">Caching</h2>

To speed up analyses, flowR provides a caching mechanism that stores intermediate results of the analysis.
The cache is maintained by the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/cache/flowr-analyzer-cache.ts#L38"><code><span title="This provides the full analyzer caching layer, please avoid using this directly and prefer the FlowrAnalyzer .">FlowrAnalyzerCache</span></code></a> class and is used automatically by the analyzer during the analysis.
Underlying, it relies on the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/core/pipeline-executor.ts#L97"><code><span title="**Please note:** The PipelineExecutor is now considered to be a rather low-level API for flowR. While it still works and is the basis for all other layers, we strongly recommend using the FlowrAnalyzer and its builder to create and use an analyzer instance that is pre-configured for your use-case. The pipeline executor allows to execute arbitrary pipelines in a step-by-step fashion. If you are not...">PipelineExecutor</span></code></a> to cache results of different pipeline stages.

Usually, you do not have to worry about the cache, as it is managed automatically by the analyzer.
If you want to overwrite cache information, the analysis methods in <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/flowr-analyzer.ts#L135"><code><span title="Central class for conducting analyses with FlowR. Use the FlowrAnalyzerBuilder to create a new instance. If you want the original pattern of creating a pipeline and running all steps, you can still do this with FlowrAnalyzer#runFull . To inspect the context of the analyzer, use FlowrAnalyzer#inspectContext (if you are a plugin and need to modify it, use FlowrAnalyzer#context instead).">FlowrAnalyzer</span></code></a> (see [Conducting Analyses](#conducting-analyses) above)
usually provide an optional `force` parameter to control whether to use the cache or recompute the results.
