_This document was generated from '[src/documentation/print-cfg-wiki.ts](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/documentation/print-cfg-wiki.ts)' on 2025-06-01, 15:49:46 UTC presenting an overview of flowR's control flow graph (v2.2.14, using R v4.4.3). Please do not edit this file/wiki page directly._

_flowR_ produces three main perspectives of the program: 1) a [normalized version of the AST](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Normalized-AST)
and 2) a [dataflow graph](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Dataflow%20Graph), and 3) a control flow graph (CFG).
flowR uses this CFG interweaved with its data flow analysis and for some of its queries (e.g., to link to the last call in a [Call-Context Query](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Query-API)).

Please note that, mostly due to historical reasons, the [control dependencies](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Dataflow%20Graph#control-dependencies) that are stored directly within the
DFG provide only a partial view of the CFG. While they provide you with information on the conditional execution of vertices, they do not encode the order of execution.
In contrast, the CFG describes a complete view of the program's control flow.


> [!TIP]
> If you want to investigate the Control Flow Graph,
> you can use the <span title="Description (Repl Command, starred version): Returns the URL to mermaid.live; Base Command: Get mermaid code for the control-flow graph of R code, start with 'file://' to indicate a file (aliases: :cfg*, :cf*)">`:controlflow*`</span> command in the REPL (see the [Interface wiki page](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Interface) for more information).
> By default, this view does _not_ use basic blocks as, for example, R allows unconditional jumps to occur in spots where conventional languages would assume expressions (e.g., if-conditions).
> Yet, by using <span title="Description (Repl Command, starred version): Returns the URL to mermaid.live; Base Command: Get mermaid code for the control-flow graph with basic blocks, start with 'file://' to indicate a file (aliases: :cfgb*, :cfb*)">`:controlflowbb*`</span> you can inspect the CFG with basic blocks (although you have to keep in mind that now, there can be a value flow between basic blocks)

<h2 id="cfg-overview">Initial Overview</h2>

For now, let's look at a CFG for a program without any branching:


```r
x <- 2 * 3 + 1
```


The corresponding CFG is a directed, labeled graph with two types of edges (control and flow dependencies).

_(The analysis required _12.9 ms_ (including the dataflow analysis,  normalization,  and parsing with the [r-shell](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Engines) engine) within the generation environment.
We used the following simplification: `unique-cf-sets` .
	)_




> [!IMPORTANT]
> As the edges describe dependencies they point in the inverse order of execution (which is very helpful for backward analyses)! The [visitors](#cfg-working) abstract away from this and there is no harm in considering an inverted CFG. Yet, you should keep this in mind!


Every normalized node of the [normalized AST](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Normalized-AST) that has any relevance to the
execution is added and automatically linked using its id (similarly to vertices of the [dataflow graph](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Dataflow%20Graph)).
Expressions, such as `2 * 3` get an additional node with an artificial id that ends in `-exit` to mark whenever their calculation is over.

To gain a better understanding, let's have a look at a simple program with a single branching structure:





```mermaid

Here, you can see the `if` node followed by the condition (in this case merely `u`) that then splits into two branches for the two possible outcomes.
The `if` structure is terminated by the corresponding `-exit` node (see the [structure](#cfg-structure) section for more details).

For you to compare, the following shows the CFG of an `if` without an `else` branch:

Which is probably much more readable if compacted (although the reconstucted code can sometimes be slightly mislieading as flowR tries its best to make it syntactically correct and hence add closing braces etc. which are technically not part of the respective block):

To check whether the CFG has the expected shape, you can use the test function [<code><span title="Assert that the given code produces the expected CFG">assertCfg</span></code>](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//test/functionality/_helper/controlflow/assert-control-flow-graph.ts#L38) which supports testing for
 sub-graphs as well (it provides diffing capabilities similar to [<code><span title="Your best friend whenever you want to test whether the dataflow graph produced by flowR is as expected.  You may want to have a look at the DataflowTestConfiguration to see what you can configure. Especially the resolveIdsAsCriterion and the expectIsSubgraph are interesting as they allow you for rather flexible matching of the expected graph.">assertDataflow</span></code>](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//test/functionality/_helper/shell.ts#L347)).
As the CFG may become unhandy for larger programs, there are simplifications available with [<code><span title="Simplify the control flow information by applying the given passes. This may reduce the vertex count, in- and outgoing edges, entry and exit points, etc.">simplifyControlFlowInformation</span></code>](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/control-flow/cfg-simplification.ts#L34)
(these can be passed on to the [<code><span title="Given a normalized AST this approximates the control flow graph of the program. This few is different from the computation of the dataflow graph and may differ, especially because it focuses on intra-procedural analysis.">extractCfg</span></code>](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/control-flow/extract-cfg.ts#L84) function as well).

We use the [<code>CfgBasicBlockVertex</code>](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/control-flow/control-flow-graph.ts#L82) to represent [basic blocks](#cfg-basic-blocks) and separate
expressions ([<code>CfgExpressionVertex</code>](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/control-flow/control-flow-graph.ts#L63)) and statements ([<code>CfgStatementVertex</code>](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/control-flow/control-flow-graph.ts#L59)) 
as control flow units with and without side effects (if you want to, you can see view statements as effectful expressions).
The markers ([<code>CfgMidMarkerVertex</code>](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/control-flow/control-flow-graph.ts#L72) and [<code>CfgEndMarkerVertex</code>](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/control-flow/control-flow-graph.ts#L78))
indicate specific segments of larger expressions/statements (e.g., an `if` which has a condition and its branches). 

To signal these links, the expressions and statements contain information about the attached markers:

In mermaid visualizations, we use rectangles for statements, rounded rectangles for expressions, circles for exit markers and double-lined rectangles for mid markers.
Blocks are visualized as boxes around the contained vertices.


> [!NOTE]
> Every CFG vertex has a [<code><span title="The type of the id assigned to each node. Branded to avoid problematic usages with other string or numeric types.">NodeId</span></code>](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/r-bridge/lang-4.x/ast/model/processing/node-id.ts#L7) that links it to the [normalized AST](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Normalized-AST) (although basic blocks will find no counterpart as they are a structuring element of the CFG).
> 	Additionally, it may provide information on the called functions (in case that the current element is a function call).
> 	Have a look at the [<code><span title="A plain vertex in the ControlFlowGraph . Please use CfgSimpleVertex to refer to all potential vertex types within the graph.">CfgBaseVertex</span></code>](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/control-flow/control-flow-graph.ts#L41) interface for more information.


<h3 id="cfg-structure-edges">CFG Edges</h3>

The [<code><span title="This class represents the control flow graph of an R program. The control flow may be hierarchical when confronted with function definitions (see CfgSimpleVertex and rootVertexIds() ).  There are two very simple visitors to traverse a CFG: - visitCfgInOrder visits the graph in the order of the vertices - visitCfgInReverseOrder visits the graph in reverse order  If you want to prohibit modification...">ControlFlowGraph</span></code>](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/control-flow/control-flow-graph.ts#L207) uses two types of edges to represent the control flow, separated by the [<code>CfgEdgeType</code>](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/control-flow/control-flow-graph.ts#L19) enum
and the two interfaces: [<code>CfgFlowDependencyEdge</code>](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/control-flow/control-flow-graph.ts#L106) and [<code>CfgControlDependencyEdge</code>](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/control-flow/control-flow-graph.ts#L110).

<h4 id="cfg-flow-dependency">Flow Dependencies</h4>

The most common edge is the flow dependency&nbsp;(FD) which simply signals that the source vertex happens _after_ the target vertex in the control flow.
So `x; y` would produce a flow dependency from `y` to `x` (additionally to the program-enveloping root expression list):





```mermaid
flowchart RL
    n2(["`RExpressionList (2)`"])
    n0(["`RSymbol (0)
#34;x#34;`"])
    n1(["`RSymbol (1)
#34;y#34;`"])
    n2-exit((2-exit))
    n0 -.->|"FD"| n2
    n1 -.->|"FD"| n0
    n2-exit -.->|"FD"| n1
    style n2 stroke:cyan,stroke-width:6.5px;    style n2-exit stroke:green,stroke-width:6.5px;
```

	
_(The analysis required _1.6 ms_ (including the dataflow analysis,  normalization,  and parsing with the [r-shell](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Engines) engine) within the generation environment.
We used the following simplification: `unique-cf-sets` .
	)_



<h4 id="cfg-control-dependency">Control Dependencies</h4>

Control dependencies&nbsp;(CD) are used to signal that the execution of the source vertex depends on the taget vertex (which, e.g., is the condition of an `if` statement or `while` loop).
They contain additional information to signal _when_ the source vertex is executed:

Please note that repeat loops do _not_ have control dependencies, as they repeat their body unconditionally.
Additionally, the control flow graph does not have to be connected. If you use a repeat without any exit condition,
the corresponding exit markers are not reachable from the entry:

<h4 id="cfg-call-links">Extra: Call Links</h4>

If you generate the CFG with the [<code><span title="Given a normalized AST this approximates the control flow graph of the program. This few is different from the computation of the dataflow graph and may differ, especially because it focuses on intra-procedural analysis.">extractCfg</span></code>](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/control-flow/extract-cfg.ts#L84) function you can (and, if you want to gain inter-procedural information, should)
pass a matching [dataflow graph](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Dataflow%20Graph) to it to incorporate the dataflow perspective into the CFG.

The difference becomes obvious when we look at the code `f <- function() b; f()` first without the dataflow graph:

There are two important additions:

1. A new exit marker, canonically suffixed with `-resolved-call-exit` signals that we are aware of the function call target.
   This marker always follows the exit marker of the function call and links not just the call but also the exit points of the function definition.
2. A new _calls_ attribute attached to the function call vertex. This holds the [<code><span title="The type of the id assigned to each node. Branded to avoid problematic usages with other string or numeric types.">NodeId</span></code>](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/r-bridge/lang-4.x/ast/model/processing/node-id.ts#L7) of the function definitions that are called from this vertex.

For built-in functions that are provided by flowR's built-in configuration (see the [interface wiki page](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Interface)) the CFG does not contain
the additional information directly:

This is due to the fact that the [dataflow graph](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Dataflow%20Graph) does contain the required call information (and there are no new control vertices to add as the built-in call has no target in the source code):

<h3 id="cfg-basic-blocks">Adding Basic Blocks</h3>

As mentioned in the introduction, our control flow graph does not use basic blocks by default and hence simply links all vertices independent of whether they have (un-)conditional jumps or not.
On the upside, this tells us the execution order (and, in case of promises, forcing order) of involved expressions and seamlessly handles cases like
`x <- return(3)`.  On the downside, this makes it hard to apply classical control flow graph algorithms and, in general, makes the graph much harder to read.
Yet, we can request basic blocks or transform an existing CFG into basic blocks using the [<code><span title="Take a control flow information of a graph without any basic blocks and convert it to a graph with basic blocks.">convertCfgToBasicBlocks</span></code>](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/control-flow/cfg-to-basic-blocks.ts#L22) function.

Any program without any (un-)conditional jumps now contains a single basic block:





```mermaid
flowchart RL
    nbb-7-exit[["`Basic Block (bb-7-exit)
x #60;#45; 2 #42; 3 #43; 1`"]]
    style nbb-7-exit stroke:cyan,stroke-width:6.5px;    style nbb-7-exit stroke:green,stroke-width:6.5px;
```

The analysis required _1.8 ms_ (including the dataflow analysis,  normalization,  and parsing with the [r-shell](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Engines) engine) within the generation environment.
We used the following simplifications: `unique-cf-sets`, `to-basic-blocks`  and render a simplified/compacted version.

In a way, using the basic blocks perspective does not remove any of these vertices (we just usually visualize them compacted as their execution order should be "obvious").

_(The analysis required _1.5 ms_ (including the dataflow analysis,  normalization,  and parsing with the [r-shell](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Engines) engine) within the generation environment.
We used the following simplifications: `unique-cf-sets`, `to-basic-blocks` .

The benefit (for comprehensibility and algorithms) becomes more apparent when we look at a more complicated program:


```r
f <- function(a, b = 3) {
 if(a > b) {
 	return(a * b);
 } else {
 	while(a < b) {
 		a <- a + 1;
 	}
 	return(a);
 }
}

print(f(21) + f(42))
```


With basic blocks, this code looks like this:

_(The analysis required _7.0 ms_ (including the dataflow analysis,  normalization,  and parsing with the [r-shell](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Engines) engine) within the generation environment.
We used the following simplification: `unique-cf-sets` .
	)_



</details>
    

And again it should be noted that even though the example code is more complicated, this is still far from the average real-world script.

<h2 id="cfg-working">Working with the CFG</h2>

There is a plethora of functions that you can use the traverse the [normalized AST](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Normalized-AST) and the [dataflow graph](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Dataflow%20Graph). 
Similarly, flowR provides you with a set of utility functions and classes that you can use to interact with the control flow graph.

<h3 id="cfg-simple-traversal">Simple Traversal</h3>

If you are just interested in traversing the vertices within the cfg, two simple functions
[<code><span title="Visit all nodes reachable from the start node in the control flow graph, traversing the dependencies in execution order but ignoring cycles.">visitCfgInOrder</span></code>](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/control-flow/simple-visitor.ts#L58) and [<code><span title="Visit all nodes reachable from the start node in the control flow graph, traversing the dependencies but ignoring cycles.">visitCfgInReverseOrder</span></code>](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/control-flow/simple-visitor.ts#L18) are available. For [basic blocks](#cfg-basic-blocks)
these will automatically traverse the elements contained within the blocks (in the respective order).
For example, the following function will return all numbers contained within the CFG:


```ts
function sampleCollectNumbers(cfg: ControlFlowInformation, ast: NormalizedAst): RNumberValue[] {
	const numbers: RNumberValue[] = [];
	visitCfgInOrder(cfg.graph, cfg.entryPoints, id => {
		/* obtain the corresponding node from the AST */
		const node = ast.idMap.get(id);
		/* if it is present and a number, add the parsed value to the list */
		if(isRNumber(node)) {
			numbers.push(node.content);
		}
	});
	return numbers;
}
```

<i>Defined at <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/documentation/print-cfg-wiki.ts#L65">./src/documentation/print-cfg-wiki.ts#L65</a></i>


Calling it with the CFG and AST of the expression `x - 1 + 2L * 3` yields the following elements (in this order):


- `{"num":1,"complexNumber":false,"markedAsInt":false}`
- `{"num":2,"complexNumber":false,"markedAsInt":true}`
- `{"num":3,"complexNumber":false,"markedAsInt":false}`

A more useful appearance of these visitors occurs with [<code><span title="Determines if node a happens before node b in the control flow graph.">happensBefore</span></code>](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/control-flow/happens-before.ts#L9) which uses the CFG to determine whether the execution
of one vertex always, maybe, or never happens before another vertex (see the corresponding [query documentation](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Query-API#happens-before-query) for more information).


<h3 id="cfg-diff-and-test">Diffing and Testing</h3>

As mentioned above, you can use the test function [<code><span title="Assert that the given code produces the expected CFG">assertCfg</span></code>](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//test/functionality/_helper/controlflow/assert-control-flow-graph.ts#L38) to check whether the control flow graph has the desired shape.
The function supports testing for sub-graphs as well (it provides diffing capabilities similar to [<code><span title="Your best friend whenever you want to test whether the dataflow graph produced by flowR is as expected.  You may want to have a look at the DataflowTestConfiguration to see what you can configure. Especially the resolveIdsAsCriterion and the expectIsSubgraph are interesting as they allow you for rather flexible matching of the expected graph.">assertDataflow</span></code>](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//test/functionality/_helper/shell.ts#L347)).
If you want to diff two control flow graphs, you can use the [<code><span title="Compare two control flow graphs and return a report on the differences. If you simply want to check whether they equal, use <result>.isEqual() .">diffOfControlFlowGraphs</span></code>](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/control-flow/diff-cfg.ts#L18) function.

<h4 id="cfg-check-properties">Checking Properties</h4>

To be a valid representation of the program, the CFG should satisfy a collection of properties that, in turn, you can automatically assume to hold
when working with it. In general, we verify these in every unit test using [<code><span title="Check if the given CFG satisfies all properties.">assertCfgSatisfiesProperties</span></code>](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/control-flow/cfg-properties.ts#L108),
and you can have a look at the active properties by checking the [<code><span title="The collection of properties that can be checked on a control flow graph.">CfgProperties</span></code>](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/control-flow/cfg-properties.ts#L10) object.
In general, we check for a hammock graph (given that the program contains no definite infinite loop) and the absence of direct cycles.

<h3 id="cfg-traversal">Sophisticated CFG Traversal</h3>

The [simple traversal](#cfg-simple-traversal) functions are great for simple tasks, but very unhandy when you want to do something more sophisticated
that incorporates language semantics such as function calls. Hence, we provide a series of incrementally more sophisticated (but complex)
visitors that incorporate various alternative perspectives:

- [Basic CFG Visitor](#cfg-traversal-basic):\
  As a class-based version of the [simple traversal](#cfg-traversal-basic) functions
- [Syntax-Aware CFG Visitor](#cfg-traversal-syntax):\
  If you want directly incorporate the type of the respective vertex in the [normalized AST](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Normalized-AST) into your visitor
- [Dataflow-Aware CFG Visitor](#cfg-traversal-dfg):\
  If you require the [dataflow information](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Dataflow%20Graph) as well (e.g., to track built-in function calls, ...)
- [Semantic CFG Visitor](#cfg-traversal-semantic):\
  Currently the most advanced visitor that combines syntactic with dataflow information.

<h4 id="cfg-traversal-basic">Basic CFG Visitor</h4>

The [<code><span title="In contrast to visitCfgInOrder and visitCfgInReverseOrder , this visitor is not a simple visitor and serves as the basis for a variety of more complicated visiting orders of the control flow graph. It includes features to provide additional information using the NormalizedAst and the DataflowGraph .  Use BasicCfgGuidedVisitor#start to start the traversal.">BasicCfgGuidedVisitor</span></code>](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/control-flow/basic-cfg-guided-visitor.ts#L25) class essential provides the same functionality as the [simple traversal](#cfg-simple-traversal) functions but in a class-based version.
Using it, you can select whether you want to traverse the CFG in order or in reverse order.

To replicate the number collector from above, you can use the following code:


```ts
class CollectNumbersVisitor extends BasicCfgGuidedVisitor {
	private numbers: RNumberValue[] = [];
	private ast:     NormalizedAst;

	constructor(controlFlow: ControlFlowInformation, ast: NormalizedAst) {

Instead of directly calling [<code><span title="Visit all nodes reachable from the start node in the control flow graph, traversing the dependencies in execution order but ignoring cycles.">visitCfgInOrder</span></code>](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/control-flow/simple-visitor.ts#L58) we pass the `forward` visiting order to the constructor of the visitor.
Executing it with the CFG and AST of the expression `x - 1 + 2L * 3`, causes the following numbers to be collected:


- `{"num":1,"complexNumber":false,"markedAsInt":false}`
- `{"num":2,"complexNumber":false,"markedAsInt":true}`
- `{"num":3,"complexNumber":false,"markedAsInt":false}`


<h4 id="cfg-traversal-syntax">Syntax-Aware CFG Visitor</h4>

The [<code><span title="This visitor extends on the BasicCfgGuidedVisitor by dispatching visitors based on the AST type of the node.  Use BasicCfgGuidedVisitor#start to start the traversal.">SyntaxAwareCfgGuidedVisitor</span></code>](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/control-flow/syntax-cfg-guided-visitor.ts#L51) class incorporates knowledge of the [normalized AST](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Normalized-AST) into the CFG traversal and
directly provides specialized visitors for the various node types.
Now, our running example of collecting all numbers simplifies to this:


```ts
class CollectNumbersSyntaxVisitor extends SyntaxAwareCfgGuidedVisitor {
	private numbers: RNumberValue[] = [];

	constructor(controlFlow: ControlFlowInformation, normalizedAst: NormalizedAst) {
		super({ controlFlow, normalizedAst, defaultVisitingOrder: 'forward' });

- `{"num":1,"complexNumber":false,"markedAsInt":false}`
- `{"num":2,"complexNumber":false,"markedAsInt":true}`
- `{"num":3,"complexNumber":false,"markedAsInt":false}`

<h4 id="cfg-traversal-dfg">Dataflow-Aware CFG Visitor</h4>

There is a lot of benefit in incorporating the [dataflow information](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Dataflow%20Graph) into the CFG traversal, as it contains
information about overwritten function calls, definition targets, and so on.
Our best friend is the [<code><span title="Obtain the (dataflow) origin of a given node in the dfg.">getOriginInDfg</span></code>](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/dataflow/origin/dfg-get-origin.ts#L101) function which provides the important information about the origin of a vertex in the dataflow graph.
The [<code><span title="This visitor extends on the BasicCfgGuidedVisitor by dispatching visitors based on the dataflow graph.

While it is not ideal for our goal of collecting all numbers, it shines in other areas such as collecting all used variables,&nbsp;...


```ts

	private numbers: RNumberValue[] = [];

The [<code><span title="This visitor extends on the DataflowAwareCfgGuidedVisitor by dispatching visitors for separate function calls as well, providing more information!

The main idea is simple, it provides special handlers for assignments, conditionals, and other R semantics but still follows
the structure of the CFG.

To explore what it is capable of, let's create a visitor that prints all values that are used in assignments:


```ts
class CollectSourcesSemanticVisitor extends SemanticCfgGuidedVisitor {
	private sources: string[] = [];

	constructor(controlFlow: ControlFlowInformation, normalizedAst: NormalizedAst, dataflow: DataflowGraph) {

			this.sources.push(recoverName(source, this.config.normalizedAst.idMap) ?? '??');
		}
	}

	public getSources(): NodeId[] {

	}
}
```

Executing it with the CFG and Dataflow of the expression `x <- 2; 3 -> x; assign("x", 42 + 21)`, causes the following values&nbsp;(/lexemes) to be collected:


- `2`
- `3`
- `+`

All in all, this visitor offers the following semantic events:

- [<code><span title="A helper function to get the normalized AST node for the given id or fail if it does not exist.">SemanticCfgGuidedVisitor::<b>getNormalizedAst</b></span></code>](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/control-flow/semantic-cfg-guided-visitor.ts#L74)\

  A helper function to request the
  <code>origins</code>
  of the given node.

- [<code><span title="This event triggers for every subsetting call, i.e., for every call to [[, [, or $.">SemanticCfgGuidedVisitor::<b>onAccessCall</b></span></code>](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/control-flow/semantic-cfg-guided-visitor.ts#L450)\
  This event triggers for every subsetting call, i.e., for every call to `[[`, `[`, or `$`.

- [<code><span title="This event triggers for every call to any of the *apply functions.  For example, lapply in lapply(1:10, function(x) { x + 1 }).

   Please be aware that replacements (e.g. assignments with a function call on the target side) like `names(x) <- 3` are subject to
  <code>`onReplacementCall`</code>

   For example, this triggers for `foo(x)` in

  ```
   This explicitly will not trigger for scenarios in which the function has no name (i.e., if it is anonymous).
  For such cases, you may rely on the
  <code>`onUnnamedCall`</code>
  event.
  The main reason for this separation is part of flowR's handling of these functions, as anonymous calls cannot be resolved using the active environment.

<h3 id="cfg-exit-points">Working With Exit Points</h3>

With the [Dataflow Graph](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Dataflow%20Graph) you already get a `returns` edge that tells you what a function call returns 
(given that this function call does neither transform nor create a value).
But the control flow perspective gives you more! Given a simple addition like `x + 1`, the CFG looks like this:





```mermaid
flowchart RL
    n3(["`RExpressionList (3)`"])
    n0(["`RSymbol (0)
#34;x#34;`"])
    n1(["`RNumber (1)
#34;1#34;`"])
    n2(["`RBinaryOp (2)
#34;x #43; 1#34;`"])
    n2-exit((2-exit))
    n3-exit((3-exit))
    n2 -.->|"FD"| n3
    n1 -.->|"FD"| n0
    n0 -.->|"FD"| n2
    n2-exit -.->|"FD"| n1
    n3-exit -.->|"FD"| n2-exit
    style n3 stroke:cyan,stroke-width:6.5px;    style n3-exit stroke:green,stroke-width:6.5px;
```

<summary style="color:gray">R Code of the CFG</summary>

The analysis required _1.1 ms_ (including the dataflow analysis,  normalization,  and parsing with the [r-shell](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Engines) engine) within the generation environment.
We used the following simplification: `unique-cf-sets` .
	


```r
x + 1
```

Looking at the binary operation vertex for `+` (with id `2`) we see that it is linked to a single exit ("end marker") point: `2-exit`.
Checking this vertex essentially reveals all exit points of the expression &dash; in this case, this simply refers to the operands of the addition.
However, the idea transfers to more complex expressions as well...

Looking at the if vertex for (with id `5`) we see that it is again linked to a single exit point: `5-exit`.
Yet, now this exit vertex is linked to the two branches of the if statement (the `then` and `else` branch).
	

</details>
    

Hence, you may rely on the corresponding exit point(s) to identify all exits of a given expression (in a way, these exit-points are merely super-sinks trying to ensure the hammock graph property).


> [!WARNING]
> Using basic blocks, this works just the same. However please keep in mind that the corresponding exit markers do not (and for control statements usually will not) be part of the same basic block.
