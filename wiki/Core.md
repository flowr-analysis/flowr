## Creating and Using a flowR Analyzer Instance

The <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/flowr-analyzer-builder.ts#L38"><code><span title="Builder for the FlowrAnalyzer , use it to configure all analysis aspects before creating the analyzer instance with .build() or .buildSync() . You can add new files and folders to analyze using the .addRequest() method on the resulting analyzer.">FlowrAnalyzerBuilder</span></code></a> class should be used as a starting point to create analyses in _flowR_.
It provides a fluent interface for the configuration and creation of a <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/flowr-analyzer.ts#L144"><code><span title="Central class for conducting analyses with FlowR. Use the FlowrAnalyzerBuilder to create a new instance. If you want the original pattern of creating a pipeline and running all steps, you can still do this with FlowrAnalyzer#runFull . To inspect the context of the analyzer, use FlowrAnalyzer#inspectContext (if you are a plugin and need to modify it, use FlowrAnalyzer#context instead).">FlowrAnalyzer</span></code></a> instance:


```ts
const analyzer = await new FlowrAnalyzerBuilder()
    .amendConfig(c => {
        c.ignoreSourceCalls = true;
    })
    .setEngine('tree-sitter')
    .build();
analyzer.addRequest('x <- 1; y <- x; print(y);');
```


Have a look at the [Engine](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Engines) wiki page to understand the different engines and parsers you can use.

The analyzer instance can then be used to access analysis results like the [normalized AST](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Normalized-AST),
the [dataflow graph](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Dataflow-Graph), and the [controlflow graph](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Control-Flow-Graph):


```ts
const normalizedAst = await analyzer.normalize();
const dataflow = await analyzer.dataflow();
const cfg = await analyzer.controlflow();
```


The underlying <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/flowr-analyzer.ts#L144"><code><span title="Central class for conducting analyses with FlowR. Use the FlowrAnalyzerBuilder to create a new instance. If you want the original pattern of creating a pipeline and running all steps, you can still do this with FlowrAnalyzer#runFull . To inspect the context of the analyzer, use FlowrAnalyzer#inspectContext (if you are a plugin and need to modify it, use FlowrAnalyzer#context instead).">FlowrAnalyzer</span></code></a> instance will take care of caching, updates, and running the appropriate steps.
It also exposes the [query API](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Query-API):


```ts
 * Shows how to use the query API to perform a static slice (please do not simplify).
 */
async function sliceQueryExample(analyzer: FlowrAnalyzer) {
	const result = await analyzer.query([{
		type:     'static-slice',
		criteria: ['1@y']
	}]);
```


One of the additional advantages of using the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/flowr-analyzer.ts#L144"><code><span title="Central class for conducting analyses with FlowR. Use the FlowrAnalyzerBuilder to create a new instance. If you want the original pattern of creating a pipeline and running all steps, you can still do this with FlowrAnalyzer#runFull . To inspect the context of the analyzer, use FlowrAnalyzer#inspectContext (if you are a plugin and need to modify it, use FlowrAnalyzer#context instead).">FlowrAnalyzer</span></code></a> is that it provides you with context information about the analysed files:


```ts
 * Shows how to inspect the context of an analyzer instance.
 */
export function inspectContextExample(analyzer: FlowrAnalyzer) {
	const ctx = analyzer.inspectContext();
	console.log('dplyr version', ctx.deps.getDependency('dplyr'));
	console.log('loading order', ctx.files.loadingOrder.getLoadingOrder());
```


## Pipelines and their Execution

At the core of every analysis done via a <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/project/flowr-analyzer.ts#L144"><code><span title="Central class for conducting analyses with FlowR. Use the FlowrAnalyzerBuilder to create a new instance. If you want the original pattern of creating a pipeline and running all steps, you can still do this with FlowrAnalyzer#runFull . To inspect the context of the analyzer, use FlowrAnalyzer#inspectContext (if you are a plugin and need to modify it, use FlowrAnalyzer#context instead).">FlowrAnalyzer</span></code></a> is the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/core/pipeline-executor.ts#L97"><code><span title="**Please note:** The PipelineExecutor is now considered to be a rather low-level API for flowR. While it still works and is the basis for all other layers, we strongly recommend using the FlowrAnalyzer and its builder to create and use an analyzer instance that is pre-configured for your use-case.

It is to be created createPipeline . If you want to get the type of all steps in the pipeline (given they are created canonically using const step names), refer to PipelineStepNames .">Pipeline</span></code></a>) and executes it
on a given input. In general, these pipeline steps are analysis agnostic and may use arbitrary input and ordering. However, two important and predefined pipelines, 
the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/core/steps/pipeline/default-pipelines.ts#L30"><code><span title="The default pipeline for working with flowR, including the dataflow step. See the DEFAULT_NORMALIZE_PIPELINE for the pipeline without the dataflow step and the DEFAULT_SLICE_AND_RECONSTRUCT_PIPELINE for the pipeline with slicing and reconstructing steps">DEFAULT_DATAFLOW_PIPELINE</span></code></a> and the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/core/steps/pipeline/default-pipelines.ts#L31"><code>TREE_SITTER_DATAFLOW_PIPELINE</code></a> adequately cover the most common analysis steps 
(differentiated only by the [Engine](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Engines) used).

Using the [`tree-sitter` engine](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Engines) you can request a dataflow analysis of a sample piece of R code like the following:


```typescript

const executor = new PipelineExecutor(TREE_SITTER_DATAFLOW_PIPELINE, {
	parser:  new TreeSitterExecutor(),
	context: contextFromInput('x <- 1; y <- x; print(y);')
});
const result = await executor.allRemainingSteps();
```


This is, roughly, what the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/benchmark/slicer.ts#L81"><code><span title="the dataflow graph produced by the 'dataflow' step">dataflow</span></code></a> function does when using the [`tree-sitter` engine](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Engines).
We create a new <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/core/pipeline-executor.ts#L97"><code><span title="**Please note:** The PipelineExecutor is now considered to be a rather low-level API for flowR. While it still works and is the basis for all other layers, we strongly recommend using the FlowrAnalyzer and its builder to create and use an analyzer instance that is pre-configured for your use-case.

If you are not...">PipelineExecutor</span></code></a> with the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/core/steps/pipeline/default-pipelines.ts#L31"><code>TREE_SITTER_DATAFLOW_PIPELINE</code></a> and then use 
<a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/core/pipeline-executor.ts#L233"><code>PipelineExecutor::<b>allRemainingSteps</b></code></a> 
to cause the execution of all contained steps (in general, pipelines can be executed step-by-step, but this is usually not required if you just want the result).

In general, however, most flowR-internal functions which are tasked with generating dataflow prefer the use of <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/core/steps/pipeline/default-pipelines.ts#L91"><code>createDataflowPipeline</code></a> as this function
automatically selects the correct pipeline based on the engine used.

### Understanding Pipeline Steps

Everything that complies to the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/core/steps/pipeline-step.ts#L70"><code><span title="Defines what is to be known of a single step in a pipeline. It wraps around a single processor function, providing additional information. Steps will be executed synchronously, in-sequence, based on their dependencies .">IPipelineStep</span></code></a> interface can be used as a step in a pipeline, with the most important definition being the
`processor` function, which refers to the actual work performed by the step.
For example, the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/core/steps/all/core/20-dataflow.ts#L33"><code>STATIC_DATAFLOW</code></a> step ultimately relies on the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/dataflow/extractor.ts#L117"><code><span title="This is the main function to produce the dataflow graph from a given request and normalized AST. Note, that this requires knowledge of the active parser in case the dataflow analysis uncovers other files that have to be parsed and integrated into the analysis (e.g., in the event of a source call). For the actual, canonical fold entry point, see processDataflowFor .">produceDataFlowGraph</span></code></a> function to create a [dataflow graph](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Dataflow-Graph) 
using the [normalized AST](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Normalized-AST) of the program.

### Shape of a Pipeline Step

Using code, you can provide an arbitrary pipeline step to the executor, as long as it implements the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/core/steps/pipeline-step.ts#L70"><code><span title="Defines what is to be known of a single step in a pipeline. It wraps around a single processor function, providing additional information. Steps will be executed synchronously, in-sequence, based on their dependencies .">IPipelineStep</span></code></a> interface:

 * **[IPipelineStep](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/core/steps/pipeline-step.ts#L70)**   
   Defines what is to be known of a single step in a pipeline.
   It wraps around a single
   <code>processor</code>
   function, providing additional information.
   Steps will be executed synchronously, in-sequence, based on their
   <code>dependencies</code>
   .

   ```ts
   
   
   /**

    * It wraps around a single {@link IPipelineStep#processor|processor} function, providing additional information.
    * Steps will be executed synchronously, in-sequence, based on their {@link IPipelineStep#dependencies|dependencies}.
    */
   export interface IPipelineStep<
       Name extends PipelineStepName = PipelineStepName,
       // eslint-disable-next-line -- by default, we assume nothing about the function shape
       Fn extends StepProcessingFunction = (...args: any[]) => any,
   > extends MergeableRecord, IPipelineStepOrder<Name> {
       /** Human-readable name of this step */
       readonly humanReadableName: string
       /** Human-readable description of this step */
       readonly description:       string
       /** The main processor that essentially performs the logic of this step */
       readonly processor:         (...input: Parameters<Fn>) => ReturnType<Fn>
       /** How to visualize the results of the respective step to the user? */
       readonly printer: {
           [K in StepOutputFormat]?: IPipelineStepPrinter<Fn, K, never[]>
       } & {
           // we always want to have an internal printer
           [StepOutputFormat.Internal]: InternalStepPrinter<Fn>
       }
       /**
        * Input configuration required to perform the respective steps.
        * Required inputs of dependencies do not have to, but can be repeated.
        * <p>
        * Use the pattern `undefined as unknown as T` to indicate that the value is required but not provided.
        */
       readonly requiredInput: object
   }
   ```
   
   
   </details>
   

Every step may specify required inputs, ways of visualizing the output, and its dependencies using the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/core/steps/pipeline-step.ts#L39"><code><span title="Contains the data to specify the order of steps in a pipeline.">IPipelineStepOrder</span></code></a> interface.
As the types may seem to be somewhat confusing or over-complicated, we recommend you to look at some existing steps, like 
the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/core/steps/all/core/00-parse.ts#L8"><code>PARSE_WITH_R_SHELL_STEP</code></a> or the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/core/steps/all/core/20-dataflow.ts#L33"><code>STATIC_DATAFLOW</code></a> step.
The pipeline executor should do a good job of scheduling these steps (usually using a topological sort), and inferring the required inputs in the type system (have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/core/steps/pipeline/pipeline.ts#L137"><code><span title="Creates a pipeline from a given collection of steps . To be valid, the collection of steps must satisfy the following set of constraints (which should be logical, when you consider what a pipeline should achieve): 0) the collection of steps is not empty 1) all names of steps are unique for the given pipeline 2) all dependencies of all steps exist 3) there are no cycles in the dependency graph 4) t...">createPipeline</span></code></a> function if you want to know more).


> [!NOTE]
> 
> Under the hood there is a step-subtype called a decoration. Such a step can be added to a pipeline to decorate the output of another one (e.g., making it more precise, re-adding debug info, ...).
> To mark a step as a decoration, you can use the `decorates` field in the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/core/steps/pipeline-step.ts#L39"><code><span title="Contains the data to specify the order of steps in a pipeline.">IPipelineStepOrder</span></code></a> interface.
> However, as such steps are currently not relevant for any of flowR's core analyses we will not go into detail here. It suffices to know how "real" steps work.

## How flowR Produces Dataflow Graphs

This section focuses on the generation of a [dataflow graph](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Dataflow-Graph) from a given R program, using the [RShell Engine](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Engines) and hence the 
<a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/core/steps/pipeline/default-pipelines.ts#L30"><code><span title="The default pipeline for working with flowR, including the dataflow step. See the DEFAULT_NORMALIZE_PIPELINE for the pipeline without the dataflow step and the DEFAULT_SLICE_AND_RECONSTRUCT_PIPELINE for the pipeline with slicing and reconstructing steps">DEFAULT_DATAFLOW_PIPELINE</span></code></a>. The [`tree-sitter` engine](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Engines) uses the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/core/steps/pipeline/default-pipelines.ts#L31"><code>TREE_SITTER_DATAFLOW_PIPELINE</code></a>), 
which replaces the parser with the integrated tree-sitter parser and hence uses a slightly adapted normalization step to produce a similar [normalized AST](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Normalized-AST).
The [dataflow graph](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Dataflow-Graph) should be the same for both engines (although [`tree-sitter`](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Engines) is faster and may be able to parse more files).

### Overview

Let's have a look at the definition of the pipeline:

 * [DEFAULT_DATAFLOW_PIPELINE](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/core/steps/pipeline/default-pipelines.ts#L30)   
   The default pipeline for working with flowR, including the dataflow step.
   See the
   <code>DEFAULT_NORMALIZE_PIPELINE</code>
   for the pipeline without the dataflow step
   and the
   <code>DEFAULT_SLICE_AND_RECONSTRUCT_PIPELINE</code>
   for the pipeline with slicing and reconstructing steps
   <details><summary style="color:gray">Defined at <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/core/steps/pipeline/default-pipelines.ts#L30">./src/core/steps/pipeline/default-pipelines.ts#L30</a></summary>
   
   
   ```ts
    DEFAULT_DATAFLOW_PIPELINE = createPipeline(PARSE_WITH_R_SHELL_STEP, NORMALIZE, STATIC_DATAFLOW)
   ```
   
   
   </details>
   

We can see that it relies on three steps:

1. **<a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/core/steps/all/core/00-parse.ts#L8">PARSE_WITH_R_SHELL_STEP</a>** ([parsing](#parsing)): Uses the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/r-bridge/shell.ts#L143"><code><span title="The RShell represents an interactive session with the R interpreter.

2. **<a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/core/steps/all/core/10-normalize.ts#L26">NORMALIZE</a>** ([normalization](#normalization)):  Normalizes the AST produced by the parser (to create a [normalized AST](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Normalized-AST)).\
   _Its main function linked as the processor is the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/benchmark/slicer.ts#L79"><span title="the normalized AST produced by the 'normalization' step, including its parent decoration">normalize</span></a> function._
3. **<a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/core/steps/all/core/20-dataflow.ts#L33">STATIC_DATAFLOW</a>** ([dataflow](#dataflow-graph-generation)): Produces the actual [dataflow graph](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Dataflow-Graph) from the normalized AST.\
   _Its main function linked as the processor is the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/dataflow/extractor.ts#L117"><span title="This is the main function to produce the dataflow graph from a given request and normalized AST.

For the actual, canonical fold entry point, see processDataflowFor .">produceDataFlowGraph</span></a> function._

To explore these steps, let's use the REPL with the (very simple and contrived) R code: `x <- 1; print(x)`.



```shell
$ docker run -it --rm eagleoutice/flowr # or npm run flowr 
flowR repl using flowR v2.8.6, R v4.5.2 (r-shell engine)
R> :parse "x <- 1; print(x)"
```

> 	All of these commands accept file paths as well, so you can write longer R code within a file, and then pass

Especially when you are just starting with flowR, we recommend using the REPL to explore the output of the different steps.

### Parsing

The parsing step uses the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/r-bridge/shell.ts#L143"><code><span title="The RShell represents an interactive session with the R interpreter. You can configure it by RShellOptions . At the moment we are using a live R session (and not networking etc.) to communicate with R easily, which allows us to install packages etc. However, this might and probably will change in the future (leaving this as a legacy mode :D)">RShell</span></code></a> to parse the input program (or, of course, the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/r-bridge/lang-4.x/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-executor.ts#L18"><code><span title="Synchronous and (way) faster alternative to the RShell using tree-sitter.">TreeSitterExecutor</span></code></a> when using the [`tree-sitter` engine](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Engines)).
To speed up the process, we use the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/r-bridge/init.ts#L6"><code><span title="Command(s) to be issued at the start of each shell">initCommand</span></code></a> function to compile the parsing function and rely on a 
custom serialization, which outputs the information in a CSV-like format.
This means, that the <span title="Description (Repl Command): Prints ASCII Art of the parsed, unmodified AST, start with 'file://' to indicate a file (aliases: :p)">`:parse`</span> command actually kind-of lies to you, as it does pretty print the serialized version which looks more like the following (this uses the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/r-bridge/retriever.ts#L157"><code>retrieveParseDataFromRCode</code></a> function with the sample code `x <- 1; print(x)`):


<details><summary>Raw parse output for <code>x <- 1; print(x)</code></summary>

For the code `x <- 1; print(x)`:


```csv
[1,1,1,6,7,0,"expr",false,"x <- 1"],[1,1,1,1,1,3,"SYMBOL",true,"x"],[1,1,1,1,3,7,"expr",false,"x"],[1,3,1,4,2,7,"LEFT_ASSIGN",true,"<-"],[1,6,1,6,4,5,"NUM_CONST",true,"1"],[1,6,1,6,5,7,"expr",false,"1"],[1,7,1,7,6,0,"';'",true,";"],[1,9,1,16,19,0,"expr",false,"print(x)"],[1,9,1,13,10,12,"SYMBOL_FUNCTION_CALL",true,"print"],[1,9,1,13,12,19,"expr",false,"print"],[1,14,1,14,11,19,"'('",true,"("],[1,15,1,15,13,15,"SYMBOL",true,"x"],[1,15,1,15,15,19,"expr",false,"x"],[1,16,1,16,14,19,"')'",true,")"]
```

Beautiful, right? I thought so too! In fact, the output is a little bit nicer, when we put it into a table-format and add the appropriate headers:

<details open>
<summary>Parse output in table format</summary>

For the code `x <- 1; print(x)`:

| line-start | col-start | line-end | col-end | id | parent | token type | terminal | text |
| ---------: | --------: | -------: | ------: | -: | -----: | ---------- | -------- | ---- |

| 1 | 16 | 1 | 16 | 14 | 19 | `')'` | true | ) |

</details>

In fact, this data is merely what R's [`base::parse`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/parse.html) and [`utils::getParseData`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/utils/html/getParseData.html) functions provide.
We then use this data in the [normalization](#normalization) step to create a [normalized AST](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Normalized-AST).

If you are interested in the raw token types that we may encounter, have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/r-bridge/lang-4.x/ast/model/type.ts#L7"><code><span title="Token types as they are produced by the R parser. Not all of them are directly handled by the normalize step. Some of them are also listed as part of the OperatorDatabase .">RawRType</span></code></a> enum.

### Normalization

The normalization function <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/benchmark/slicer.ts#L79"><code><span title="the normalized AST produced by the 'normalization' step, including its parent decoration">normalize</span></code></a> takes the output from the previous steps and uses the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/r-bridge/lang-4.x/ast/parser/json/format.ts#L52"><code><span title="Takes the raw RShell output and extracts the csv information contained">prepareParsedData</span></code></a> and 
<a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/r-bridge/lang-4.x/ast/parser/json/format.ts#L87"><code><span title="Takes the CSV-Entries and maps them to the old json format for compatibility.">convertPreparedParsedData</span></code></a> functions to first transform the serialized parsing output to an object. 
Next, <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/r-bridge/lang-4.x/ast/parser/main/internal/structure/normalize-root.ts#L17"><code><span title="Takes the parse data as object and produces an undecorated, normalized AST.">normalizeRootObjToAst</span></code></a> transforms this object to a normalized AST and <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/r-bridge/lang-4.x/ast/model/processing/decorate.ts#L147"><code><span title="Covert the given AST into a doubly linked tree while assigning ids (so it stays serializable).">decorateAst</span></code></a> adds additional information to the AST (like roles, ids, depth, etc.).
While looking at the mermaid visualization of such an AST is nice and usually sufficient, looking at the objects themselves shows you the full range of information the AST provides (all encompassed within the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/r-bridge/lang-4.x/ast/model/model.ts#L161"><code><span title="The RNode type is the union of all possible nodes in the R-ast. It should be used whenever you either not care what kind of node you are dealing with or if you want to handle all possible nodes.   All other subtypes (like RLoopConstructs ) listed above can be used to restrict the kind of node. They do not have to be exclusive, some nodes can appear in multiple subtypes.">RNode</span></code></a> type).

Let's have a look at the normalized AST for the sample code `x <- 1; print(x)` (please refer to the [normalized AST](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Normalized-AST) wiki page for more information):

This is… a lot! We get the type from the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/r-bridge/lang-4.x/ast/model/type.ts#L158"><code><span title="Types as we use them for our normalized AST. See RNode for a union type of all normalized AST nodes in-use. For each enum member, the respective normalized AST node should be referenced in the corresponding comment.">RType</span></code></a> enum, the lexeme, location information, an id, the children of the node, and their parents.
While the [normalized AST](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Normalized-AST) wiki page provides you with information on how to interpret this data, we will focus on how we get it from the
table provided by the [parsing](#parsing) step.

There are two important functions: <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/r-bridge/lang-4.x/ast/parser/main/internal/structure/normalize-root.ts#L17"><code><span title="Takes the parse data as object and produces an undecorated, normalized AST.">normalizeRootObjToAst</span></code></a>, which operates on the parse-output already transformed into a tree-like structure,
and <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/r-bridge/lang-4.x/ast/model/processing/decorate.ts#L147"><code><span title="Covert the given AST into a doubly linked tree while assigning ids (so it stays serializable).">decorateAst</span></code></a>, which adds additional information to the AST.
Both follow a [fold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fold_(higher-order_function)) pattern.
The fold is explicit for <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/r-bridge/lang-4.x/ast/model/processing/decorate.ts#L147"><code><span title="Covert the given AST into a doubly linked tree while assigning ids (so it stays serializable).">decorateAst</span></code></a>, which directly relies on the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/r-bridge/lang-4.x/ast/model/processing/stateful-fold.ts#L77"><code><span title="Folds in old functional-fashion over the AST structure but allowing for a down function which can pass context to child nodes.">foldAstStateful</span></code></a> function,
while <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/r-bridge/lang-4.x/ast/parser/main/internal/structure/normalize-root.ts#L17"><code><span title="Takes the parse data as object and produces an undecorated, normalized AST.">normalizeRootObjToAst</span></code></a> uses the fold-idiom but deviates in cases in which (for example) we require more information on other nodes to know what it should be normalized too.

#### Normalizing the Object

We have a handler for everything. For example <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/r-bridge/lang-4.x/ast/parser/main/internal/control/normalize-if-then.ts#L13"><code><span title="Try to parse the construct as a RIfThenElse .">tryNormalizeIfThen</span></code></a> or <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/r-bridge/lang-4.x/ast/parser/main/internal/loops/normalize-for.ts#L21"><code>tryNormalizeFor</code></a> to handle `if(x) y` or `for(i in 1:10) x` constructs.
All of these handlers contain many sanity checks to be sure that we talk to an <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/r-bridge/shell.ts#L143"><code><span title="The RShell represents an interactive session with the R interpreter.

These functions contain the keyword `try` as they may fail. For example, whenever they notice late into normalization that they should actually be a different construct (R is great).
For single nodes, we use <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/r-bridge/lang-4.x/ast/parser/main/internal/structure/normalize-single-node.ts#L24"><code><span title="Parses a single structure in the ast based on its type (e.g., a string, a number, a symbol, ...)">normalizeSingleNode</span></code></a> which contains a catch-all for some edge-cases in the R grammar.

#### Decorating the AST

The decoration is comparatively trivial. We take the AST throw it into the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/r-bridge/lang-4.x/ast/model/processing/decorate.ts#L147"><code><span title="Covert the given AST into a doubly linked tree while assigning ids (so it stays serializable).">decorateAst</span></code></a> function (which again, handles each normalized node type) and
get:

1. The AST with ids, roles, and depth information (see the [normalized AST](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Normalized-AST) wiki page for more information).
2. A mapping of ids to nodes in the form of a <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/r-bridge/lang-4.x/ast/model/processing/decorate.ts#L115"><code>AstIdMap</code></a> object. This allows us to quickly access nodes by their id.

The ids used for the AST generation are arbitrary (usually created by the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/r-bridge/lang-4.x/ast/model/processing/decorate.ts#L39"><code><span title="The simplest id generator which just increments a number on each call.">deterministicCountingIdGenerator</span></code></a>) function) but unique and intentionally
separated from the ids used by the R&nbsp;parser. For one, this detaches us from the [Engine](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Engines) used, and secondly, it allows for much easier
extension of the AST (e.g., when R&nbsp;files use [`base::source`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/source.html) to include other R&nbsp;files).
All ids conform to the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/r-bridge/lang-4.x/ast/model/processing/node-id.ts#L7"><code><span title="The type of the id assigned to each node. Branded to avoid problematic usages with other string or numeric types.">NodeId</span></code></a> type.

### Dataflow Graph Generation

The core of the dataflow graph generation works as a "stateful [fold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fold_(higher-order_function))", 
which uses the tree-like structure of the AST to combine the dataflow information of the children, while tracking the currently active variables and control flow 
information as a “backpack” (state).
We use the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/dataflow/extractor.ts#L117"><code><span title="This is the main function to produce the dataflow graph from a given request and normalized AST. Note, that this requires knowledge of the active parser in case the dataflow analysis uncovers other files that have to be parsed and integrated into the analysis (e.g., in the event of a source call). For the actual, canonical fold entry point, see processDataflowFor .">produceDataFlowGraph</span></code></a> function as an entry point to the dataflow generation (the actual fold entry is in <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/dataflow/processor.ts#L68"><code><span title="Originally, dataflow processor was written as a two-way fold, but this produced problems when trying to resolve function calls which require information regarding the calling *and* definition context. While this only is a problem for late bindings as they happen with functions (and probably quote'd R-expressions), it is still a problem that must be dealt with. Therefore, the dataflow processor has...">processDataflowFor</span></code></a>).
The function is mainly backed by its <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/dataflow/extractor.ts#L34"><code><span title="The best friend of produceDataFlowGraph and processDataflowFor . Maps every RType in the normalized AST to a processor.">processors</span></code></a> object which maps each type in the normalized AST to an appropriate handler ("fold-function").

To understand these handlers, let's start with the simplest one, <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/dataflow/internal/process/process-uninteresting-leaf.ts#L11"><code><span title="Processes a leaf node that does not contribute to dataflow by initializing a clean dataflow information object for it. This can be used to ignore nodes that do not affect dataflow analysis.">processUninterestingLeaf</span></code></a> signals that 
we do not care about this node and just produce an empty dataflow information (using <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/dataflow/info.ts#L168"><code><span title="Initializes an empty DataflowInformation object with the given entry point and data. This is to be used as a 'starting point' when processing leaf nodes during the dataflow extraction.">initializeCleanDataflowInformation</span></code></a>). 
Looking at the function showcases the general structure of a processor:

 * [processUninterestingLeaf](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/dataflow/internal/process/process-uninteresting-leaf.ts#L11)   
   Processes a leaf node that does not contribute to dataflow by initializing
   a clean dataflow information object for it.
   This can be used to ignore nodes that do not affect dataflow analysis.

   ```ts
   
   
   
   /**
    * Processes a leaf node that does not contribute to dataflow by initializing
    * a clean dataflow information object for it.
    * This can be used to ignore nodes that do not affect dataflow analysis.
    */
   export function processUninterestingLeaf<OtherInfo>(leaf: RNodeWithParent, info: DataflowProcessorInformation<OtherInfo>): DataflowInformation {
       return initializeCleanDataflowInformation(leaf.info.id, info);
   }
   ```
   
   
   </details>
   

Every processor has the same shape. It takes the normalized node (see the [normalized AST](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Normalized-AST) for more information),
and a <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/dataflow/processor.ts#L15"><code>DataflowProcessorInformation</code></a> object which, as some kind of "backpack" carries global information
to every handler. 
This information is to be used to create a <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/dataflow/info.ts#L138"><code><span title="The dataflow information is one of the fundamental structures we have in the dataflow analysis.

Please note, that we add the [value vertex](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Dataflow-Graph#value-vertex) to the newly created dataflow graph,
which holds a reference to the constant. If you are confused with the use of the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/r-bridge/lang-4.x/ast/model/processing/decorate.ts#L105"><code>ParentInformation</code></a> type, 
this stems from the [AST decoration](#normalization) and signals that we have a decorated <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/r-bridge/lang-4.x/ast/model/model.ts#L161"><code><span title="The RNode type is the union of all possible nodes in the R-ast. It should be used whenever you either not care what kind of node you are dealing with or if you want to handle all possible nodes.   All other subtypes (like RLoopConstructs ) listed above can be used to restrict the kind of node. They do not have to be exclusive, some nodes can appear in multiple subtypes.">RNode</span></code></a> (which may have additional information in `OtherInfo`).

Yet again, this is not very interesting. When looking at the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/dataflow/extractor.ts#L34"><code><span title="The best friend of produceDataFlowGraph and processDataflowFor . Maps every RType in the normalized AST to a processor.">processors</span></code></a> object you may be confused by
many lines just mapping the node to the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/dataflow/internal/process/process-named-call.ts#L13"><code><span title="Helper function for processNamedCall using the given functionName as the name of the function.">processAsNamedCall</span></code></a> function.
This is because during the dataflow analysis we actually "desugar" the AST, and treat syntax constructs like binary operators (e.g., `x + y`) as function calls (e.g. `` `+`(x, y) ``).
We do this, because R does it the same way, and allows to even overwrite these operators (including `if`, `<-`, etc.) by their name.
By treating them like R, as function calls, we get support for these overwrites for free, courtesy of flowR's call resolution.

But where are all the interesting things handled then? 
For that, we want to have a look at the built-in environment, which can be freely configured using flowR's [configuration system](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Interface#configuring-flowr).
FlowR's heart and soul resides in the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/dataflow/environments/default-builtin-config.ts#L104"><code><span title="Contains the built-in definitions recognized by flowR">DefaultBuiltinConfig</span></code></a> object, which is used to configure the built-in environment
by mapping function names to <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/dataflow/environments/built-in.ts#L263"><code>BuiltInProcessorMapper</code></a> functions.
There you can find functions like <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/dataflow/internal/process/functions/call/built-in/built-in-access.ts#L53"><code><span title="Processes different types of access operations.  Example:   a[i] a$foo a[[i]] a@foo  ">processAccess</span></code></a> which handles the (subset) access to a variable, 
or <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/dataflow/internal/process/functions/call/built-in/built-in-for-loop.ts#L35"><code><span title="Processes a for-loop call: for(<variable> in <vector>) <body> desugared as:   for(<variable>, <vector>, <body>)  ">processForLoop</span></code></a> which handles the primitive for loop construct (whenever it is not overwritten).

Just as an example, we want to have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/dataflow/internal/process/functions/call/built-in/built-in-repeat-loop.ts#L30"><code><span title="Process a built-in repeat loop function call like repeat { ... }.">processRepeatLoop</span></code></a> function, as it is one of the simplest built-in processors
we have:

   export function processRepeatLoop<OtherInfo>(
       name: RSymbol<OtherInfo & ParentInformation>,

Similar to any other built-in processor, we get the name of the function call which caused us to land here,
as well as the passed arguments. The `rootId` refers to what caused the call to happen (and is usually just the function call),
while `data` is our good old backpack, carrying all the information we need to produce a dataflow graph.

After a couple of common sanity checks at the beginning which we use to check whether the repeat loop is used in a way that we expect,
we start by issuing the fold continuation by processing its arguments. Given we expect `repeat <body>`, we expect only a single argument.
During the processing we make sure to stitch in the correct control dependencies, adding the repeat loop to the mix.
For just the repeat loop the stitching is actually not necessary, but this way the handling is consistent for all looping constructs.

Afterward, we take the `processedArguments`, perform another round of sanity checks and then use two special functions to apply the
semantic effects of the repeat loop. We first use one of flowR's linkers to
<a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/dataflow/internal/linker.ts#L505"><code><span title="all loops variables which are open read (not already bound by a redefinition within the loop) get a maybe read marker to their last definition within the loop e.g. with:   for(i in 1:10) {  x_1 <- x_2 + 1 }   x_2 must get a read marker to x_1 as x_1 is the active redefinition in the second loop iteration.">linkCircularRedefinitionsWithinALoop</span></code></a> and then retrieve the active exit points with <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/dataflow/info.ts#L235"><code><span title="Filters out exit points which end their cascade within a loop.">filterOutLoopExitPoints</span></code></a>.

Feel free to have a look around and explore the other handlers for now. Each of them uses the results of its children alongside the active backpack 
to produce a new dataflow information.

## Beyond the Dataflow Graph

Given the [dataflow graph](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Dataflow-Graph), you can do a lot more!
You can issue [queries](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Query-API) to explore the graph, [search](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Search-API) for specific elements, or, for example, request a [static backward slice](#static-backward-slicing).
Of course, all of these endeavors work not just with the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/r-bridge/shell.ts#L143"><code><span title="The RShell represents an interactive session with the R interpreter. You can configure it by RShellOptions . At the moment we are using a live R session (and not networking etc.) to communicate with R easily, which allows us to install packages etc. However, this might and probably will change in the future (leaving this as a legacy mode :D)">RShell</span></code></a> but also with the [`tree-sitter` engine](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Engines). 

### Static Backward Slicing

The slicing is available as an extra step as you can see by inspecting he <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/core/steps/pipeline/default-pipelines.ts#L18"><code>DEFAULT_SLICING_PIPELINE</code></a>.
Besides <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/core/steps/all/static-slicing/00-slice.ts#L32"><code>STATIC_SLICE</code></a> it contains a <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/core/steps/all/static-slicing/10-reconstruct.ts#L28"><code>NAIVE_RECONSTRUCT</code></a> to print the slice as (executable) R code.

Your main point of interesting here is the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/slicing/static/static-slicer.ts#L32"><code><span title="This returns the ids to include in the static slice of the given type, when slicing with the given seed id's (must be at least one).   The returned ids can be used to reconstruct the slice to R code .">staticSlice</span></code></a> function which relies on a modified
breadth-first search to collect all nodes which are part of the slice. 
For more information on how the slicing works, please refer to the [tool demonstration (Section 3.2)](https://doi.org/10.1145/3691620.3695359),
or the [original master's thesis (Chapter 4)](https://doi.org/10.18725/OPARU-50107).

You can explore the slicing using the REPL with the <span title="Description (Repl Command): Static backwards executable slicer for R">`:slicer`</span> command:



```shell
$ docker run -it --rm eagleoutice/flowr # or npm run flowr

## Helpful Things

### Getting flowR to Talk

When using flowR from the CLI, you can use the <span title="Description (Command Line Argument): Run with verbose logging (will be passed to the corresponding script)">`--verbose`</span> option to get more information about what flowR is doing.
While coding, however, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//test/functionality/_helper/log.ts#L9"><code><span title="Update the minimum level of all flowr loggers.">setMinLevelOfAllLogs</span></code></a> function to set the minimum level of logs to be displayed (this works with the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/util/log.ts#L10"><code>FlowrLogger</code></a> abstraction).
In general, you can configure the levels of individual logs, such as the general `log` (obtained with <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/util/log.ts#L61"><code>getActiveLog</code></a>) or the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/r-bridge/lang-4.x/ast/parser/json/parser.ts#L14"><code>parseLog</code></a>.
Please note that flowR makes no guarantees that log outputs are persistent across versions, and it is up to the implementors to provide sensible logging.
If you are an implementor and want to add logging, please make sure there are no larger runtime impliciations when logging is disabled. 
Have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/util/log.ts#L4"><code>expensiveTrace</code></a> function for example, which uses a function to generate the log message only when the log level is reached.
