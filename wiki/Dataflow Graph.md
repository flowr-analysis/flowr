_This document was generated from '[src/documentation/wiki-dataflow-graph.ts](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/documentation/wiki-dataflow-graph.ts)' on 2025-11-23, 20:52:54 UTC presenting an overview of flowR's dataflow graph (v2.6.2, using R v4.5.1). Please do not edit this file/wiki page directly._

This page briefly summarizes flowR's dataflow graph, represented by the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/dataflow/graph/graph.ts#L137"><code><span title="The dataflow graph holds the dataflow information found within the given AST. We differentiate the directed edges in EdgeType and the vertices indicated by DataflowGraphVertexArgument The vertices of the graph are organized in a hierarchical fashion, with a function-definition node containing the node ids of its subgraph. However, all *edges* are hoisted at the top level in the form of an (attribu...">DataflowGraph</span></code></a> class within the code.
In case you want to manually build such a graph (e.g., for testing), you can use the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/dataflow/graph/dataflowgraph-builder.ts#L33"><code><span title="This DataflowGraphBuilder extends DataflowGraph with builder methods to easily and compactly add vertices and edges to a dataflow graph. Its usage thus simplifies writing tests for dataflow graphs.">DataflowGraphBuilder</span></code></a>.
If you are interested in which features we support and which features are still to be worked on, please refer to our [capabilities](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Capabilities) page.
In summary, we discuss the following topics:

- [Vertices](#vertices)
- [Edges](#edges)
- [Control Dependencies](#control-dependencies)
- [Dataflow Information](#dataflow-information)
	- [Unknown Side Effects](#unknown-side-effects)
- [Working with the Dataflow Graph](#dfg-working)

Please be aware that the accompanied [dataflow information](#dataflow-information) (<a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/dataflow/info.ts#L86"><code><span title="The dataflow information is one of the fundamental structures we have in the dataflow analysis.

like the entry and exit points of the subgraphs, and currently active references (see [below](#dataflow-information)).
Additionally, you may be interested in the set of [Unknown Side Effects](#unknown-side-effects), marking calls which _flowR_ is unable to handle correctly.

Potentially, you are interested in another perspective that flowR provides, the [control flow graph](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Control%20Flow%20Graph), so please check the correpsonding

<summary style="color:gray">R Code of the Dataflow Graph</summary>

The analysis required _10.6 ms_ (including parse and normalize, using the [tree-sitter](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Engines) engine) within the generation environment. 
We encountered no unknown side effects during the analysis.

The above dataflow graph showcases the general gist. We define a dataflow graph as a directed graph G = (V, E), differentiating between 5 types of vertices V and
9 types of edges E allowing each vertex to have a single, and each edge to have multiple distinct types.
Additionally, every node may have links to its [control dependencies](#control-dependencies) (which you may view as a 10th edge type, 
although they are explicitly no data dependency and relate to the [Control Flow Graph](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Control%20Flow%20Graph)).

From an implementation perspective all of these types are represented by respective interfaces, see [`./src/dataflow/graph/vertex.ts`](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main/./src/dataflow/graph/vertex.ts) and [`./src/dataflow/graph/edge.ts`](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main/./src/dataflow/graph/edge.ts).

The following sections present details on the different types of vertices and edges, including examples and explanations.

> [!NOTE]
> Every dataflow vertex holds an `id` which links it to the respective node in the [normalized AST](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Normalized-AST).

Please be aware that such nodes may be the result from language semantics as well, and not just from constants directly in the source.
For example, an access operation like `df$column` will treat the column name as a constant value.


<details><summary>Example: Semantics Create a Value</summary>

In the following graph, the original type printed by mermaid is still `RSymbol` (from the [normalized AST](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Normalized-AST)), however, the shape of the vertex signals to you that the symbol is in-fact treated as a constant! If you do not know what `df$column` even means, please refer to the [R topic](https://rdrr.io/r/base/Extract.html).

Most often, you will see the _use_ vertex whenever a variable is read.
However, similar to the [value vertex](#value-vertex), the _use_ vertex can also be the result of language semantics.
Consider a case, in which we refer to a variable with a string, as in `get("x")`.


<details><summary>Example: Semantics Create a Symbol</summary>

In the following graph, the original type printed by mermaid is still `RString` (from the [normalized AST](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Normalized%20AST)), however, the shape of the vertex signals to you that the symbol is in-fact treated as a variable use! If you are unsure what `get` does, refer to the [documentation](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/get). Please note, that the lexeme being printed as `"x"` may be misleading (after all it is recovered from the AST), the quotes are not part of the reference.

But now to the interesting stuff: how do we actually know which values are read by the respective variable use?
This usually involves a [variable definition](#variable-definition-vertex) and a [reads edge](#reads-edge) linking the two.

In the following graph, the `x` is read from the definition `x <- 1`.

Describes any kind of function call, including unnamed calls and those that happen implicitly!
In general the vertex provides you with information about 
the _name_ of the called function, the passed _arguments_, and the _environment_ in which the call happens (if it is of importance).

However, the implementation reveals that it may hold an additional `onlyBuiltin` flag to indicate that the call is only calling builtin functions &mdash; however, this is only a flag to improve performance,
and it should not be relied on as it may under-approximate the actual calling targets (e.g., being `false` even though all calls resolve to builtins).

There is another element of potential interest to you, the `origin` property which records how flowR created the respective function call.
These origins may hold the name of any processor that is part of the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/dataflow/environments/built-in.ts#L178"><code>BuiltInProcessorMapper</code></a> to signal that the respective processor was responsible for creating the vertex.
The entry `function` signals that flowR used a processor for a user-defined function defined within the source code, `unnamed` signals that the function as an anonymous function definition.
However, in general, flowR may use any fitting handler as an origin. For example, within a access definition, flowR will correspondingly redefine the meaning of `:=` to that of the `table:assign`. 


<details><summary>Example: Simple Function Call (unresolved)</summary>


To get a better understanding, let's look at a simple function call without any known call target, like `foo(x,3,y=3,)`:





```mermaid
flowchart LR
    1(["`#91;RSymbol#93; x
      (1)

    7(["`#91;RArgument#93; y
      (7)
      *1.9*`"])
    8[["`#91;RFunctionCall#93; foo

      *1.1-13*
    (1, 3, y (7), [empty])`"]]

<summary style="color:gray">R Code of the Dataflow Graph</summary>

The analysis required _1.0 ms_ (including parse and normalize, using the [tree-sitter](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Engines) engine) within the generation environment. The following marks are used in the graph to highlight sub-parts (uses ids): {8}.
We encountered no unknown side effects during the analysis.


```r
foo(x,3,y=3,)
```



</details>



In this case, we have a function call vertex with id `8` and the following arguments:


```json
[
  {
    "nodeId": 1,
    "type": 32
  },
  {
    "nodeId": 3,
    "type": 32
  },
  {
    "nodeId": 7,
    "name": "y",
    "type": 32
  },
  "<>"
]
```


Of course now, this is hard to read in this form (although the ids of the arguments can be mapped pretty easily to the visualization),
as the `type` of these references is a bit-mask, encoding one of the following reference types:

| Value | Reference Type |
|------:|----------------|
| 1 | Unknown |
| 2 | Function |
| 4 | Variable |
| 8 | Constant |
| 16 | Parameter |
| 32 | Argument |
| 64 | BuiltInConstant |
| 128 | BuiltInFunction |

In other words, we classify the references as Argument, Argument, Argument, and the (special) empty argument type (`<>`).
For more information on the types of references, please consult the implementation.

 * **[ReferenceType](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/dataflow/environments/identifier.ts#L20)**   
   Each reference has exactly one reference type, stored as the respective number.
   However, when checking, we may want to allow for one of several types,
   allowing the combination of the respective bitmasks.
    Having reference types is important as R separates a variable definition from
   a function when resolving an
   <code>identifier</code>
   .
   In `c <- 3; print(c(1, 2))` the call to `c` works normally (as the vector constructor),
   while writing `c <- function(...) ..1` overshadows the built-in and causes `print` to only output the first element.

Function calls are the most complicated mechanism in R as essentially everything is a function call.
Even **control structures** like `if(p) a else b` are desugared into function calls (e.g., as `` `if`(p, a, b) ``).

Similarly, you should be aware of calls to **anonymous functions**, which may appear given directly (e.g. as `(function() 1)()`) or indirectly, with code
directly calling the return of another function call: `foo()()`.

Another interesting case is a function with **side effects**, most prominently with the super-assignment `<<-`.
In this case, you may encounter the [`side-effect-on-call`](#side-effect-on-call) as exemplified below.

The example may be misleading as the visualization uses `recoverName` to print the lexeme of the variable. However, this actually defines the variable `x` (without the quotes) as you can see with the [`reads`](#reads) edge.

Please be aware, that the name of the symbol defined may differ from what you read in the program as R allows the assignments to strings, escaped names, and more:

Defining a function does do a lot of things: 1) it creates a new scope, 2) it may introduce parameters which act as promises and which are only evaluated if they are actually required in the body, 3) it may access the enclosing environments and the callstack.
The vertex object in the dataflow graph stores multiple things, including all exit points, the enclosing environment if necessary, and the information of the subflow (the "body" of the function).

Reads edges mark that the source vertex (usually a [use vertex](#use-vertex)) reads whatever is defined by the target vertex (usually a [variable definition](#variable-definition-vertex)).


> [!NOTE]

> Our abstract domains resolving transitive [`reads`](#reads) edges (and for that matter, following [`returns`](#returns) as well)

Reads edges may point to built-in definitions as well, to signal that something relates to a built-in element of flowR.
Their targets are not part of the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/dataflow/graph/graph.ts#L137"><code><span title="The dataflow graph holds the dataflow information found within the given AST.

Link the [function call](#function-call-vertex) to the exit points of the target definition (this may incorporate the call-context).
As you can see in the example, this happens for user-defined functions (like `foo`) as well as for built-in functions (like `<-`).
However, these edges are specific to scenarios in which flowR knows that a specific element is returned. 
For contrast, compare this to a use of, for example, `+`:

Here, we do not get a [`returns`](#returns) edge as this function call creates a new value based on its arguments.
In these scenarios you should rely on the `args` property of the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/dataflow/graph/vertex.ts#L237"><code><span title="Arguments required to construct a vertex which represents the call to a function in the dataflow graph . This describes all kinds of function calls, including calls to built-ins and control-flow structures such as if or for (they are treated as function calls in R).">DataflowGraphVertexFunctionCall</span></code></a> 
and use the arguments to calculate what you need to know. Alternatively, you can track the [`argument`](#argument) edges.

In general, the [`returns`](#returns) edge already does most of the heavy lifting for you, by respecting control flow influences and
(as long as flowR is able to detect it) dead code.


<details><summary>Example: Tricky Returns</summary>

We show the _simplified_ DFG for simplicity and highlight all [`returns`](#returns) edges involved in tracking the return of a call to `f` (as [`returns`](#returns) are never transitive and must hence be followed):

The analysis required _0.9 ms_ (including parse and normalize, using the [tree-sitter](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Engines) engine) within the generation environment. The following marks are used in the graph to highlight sub-parts (uses ids): {19->15, 15->14, 14->12, 14->11, 11->9, 9->7}.
We encountered no unknown side effects during the analysis.


```r
f <- function() { if(u) { return(3); 2 } else 42 }
f()
```



</details>



 Note, that the `2` should be completely absent of the dataflow graph (recognized as dead code).

*This edge is usually joined with [`defined-by-on-call`](#defined-by-on-call)!*

 Links an argument to whichever parameter they cause to be defined if the related function call is invoked.
 
 In the context of functions which access their closure environment these edges play another tricky role as there are many cases 
 made more difficult by R's way of allowing closure environments to later receive variables.
 Consider the following scenario in which we first define a function which returns the value of a variable named `x` and then define `x`
 only after we defined the function:
   



```r
f <- function() x
x <- 3
f()
```

 The final call evaluates to `3` (similar to if we defined `x` before the function definition).
 Within a dataflow graph you can see this with two edges. The `x` within the function body will have a [`defined-by-on-call`](#defined-by-on-call) 
 to every definition it _may_ refer to. In turn, each call vertex calling the function which encloses the use of `x` will have a
 [`defines-on-call`](#defines-on-call) edge to the definition(s) it causes to be active within the function body.

Links a [function call](#function-call-vertex) to the entry point of its arguments. If we do not know the target of such a call, we automatically assume that all arguments are read by the call as well!
		
The exception to this is the [function definition](#function-definition-vertex) which does no longer hold these argument relationships (as they are not implicit in the structure).

The analysis required _0.3 ms_ (including parse and normalize, using the [tree-sitter](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Engines) engine) within the generation environment. The following marks are used in the graph to highlight sub-parts (uses ids): {5->3, 5->1, 5->2}.
We encountered no unknown side effects during the analysis.


```r

This works, even if we have a larger expression in `quote`.

<h2 id="control-dependencies">Control Dependencies</h2>

Each vertex may have a list of active control dependencies.
They hold the <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/r-bridge/lang-4.x/ast/model/processing/node-id.ts#L7"><code><span title="The type of the id assigned to each node. Branded to avoid problematic usages with other string or numeric types.">NodeId</span></code></a> of all nodes that effect if the current vertex is part of the execution or not,
and a boolean flag `when` to indicate if the control dependency is active when the condition is `true` or `false`.

As an example, consider the following dataflow graph:





```mermaid
flowchart LR
    0(["`#91;RSymbol#93; p
      (0)
      *1.4*`"])

Whenever we visualize a graph, we represent the control dependencies as grayed out edges with a `CD` prefix, followed
by the `when` flag.
In the above example, both `a` and `b` depend on the `if`. Please note that they are _not_ linked to the result of
the condition itself as this is the more general linkage point (and harmonizes with other control structures, especially those which are user-defined).

<h2 id="dataflow-information">Dataflow Information</h2>

Using _flowR's_ code interface (see the [Interface](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Interface#creating-flowr-analyses) wiki page for more), you can generate the dataflow information
for a given piece of R code (in this case `x <- 1; x + 1`) as follows:


```ts
const analyzer = await new FlowrAnalyzerBuilder(requestFromInput('x <- 1
x + 1')).build();
const result = await analyzer.dataflow();
```


<details>

<summary style="color:gray">Transpiled Code</summary>

The actual code we are using in case the example above gets oudated:


```ts
async function dummyDataflow() {
    const analyzer = await new flowr_analyzer_builder_1.FlowrAnalyzerBuilder().build();
    analyzer.addRequest('x <- 1\nx + 1');
    const result = await analyzer.dataflow();
    analyzer.close();
    return result;
}
```


</details>


Now, you can find the dataflow _information_ with `result.dataflow`. More specifically, the graph is stored in `result.dataflow.graph` and looks like this:




```mermaid
flowchart LR
    1{{"`#91;RNumber#93; 1

    5[["`#91;RBinaryOp#93; #43;

    style built-in:_ stroke:gray,fill:lightgray,stroke-width:2px,opacity:.8;

However, the dataflow information contains more, quite a lot of information in fact.

Let's start by looking at the properties of the dataflow information object: `unknownReferences`, `in`, `out`, `environment`, `graph`, `entryPoint`, `exitPoints`, `cfgQuick`, `.meta`.



There are three sets of references.
**in** (ids: [2,5]) and **out** (ids: [0]) contain the 
ingoing and outgoing references of the subgraph at hand (in this case, the whole code, as we are at the end of the dataflow analysis).
Besides the Ids, they also contain important meta-information (e.g., what is to be read).
The third set, **unknownReferences**, contains all references that are not yet identified as read or written 
(the example does not have any, but, for example, `x` (with id 0) would first be unknown and then later classified as a definition).

The **environment** property contains the active environment information of the subgraph.
In other words, this is a linked list of tables (scopes), mapping identifiers to their respective definitions.
A summarized version of the produced environment looks like this:

| Name | Definitions |
|------|-------------|
| `x` | {**x** (id: 0, type: Variable, def. @2)} |

<details><summary style="color:gray"> Parent Environment</summary>

_Built-in Environment (738 entries)_

</details>

This shows us that the local environment contains a single definition for `x` (with id 0) and that the parent environment is the built-in environment.
Additionally, we get the information that the node with the id 2 was responsible for the definition of `x`.

Last but not least, the information contains the single **entry point** (2) and a set of **exit points** ([5]). 
Besides marking potential exits, the exit points also provide information about why the exit occurs and which control dependencies affect the exit.

### Unknown Side Effects

In case _flowR_ encounters a function call that it cannot handle, it marks the call as an unknown side effect.
You can find these as part of the dataflow graph, specifically as `unknownSideEffects` (with a leading underscore if sesrialized as JSON).
In the following graph, _flowR_ realizes that it is unable to correctly handle the impacts of the `load` call and therefore marks it as such (marked in bright red):

<summary style="color:gray">R Code of the Dataflow Graph</summary>

The analysis required _0.7 ms_ (including parse and normalize, using the [tree-sitter](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Engines) engine) within the generation environment. 
We encountered unknown side effects (with ids: 3, 9 (linked)) during the analysis.


```r
load("file")
print(x + y)
```



</details>



In general, as we cannot handle these correctly, we leave it up to other analyses (and [queries](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Query%20API)) to handle these cases
as they see fit.

#### Linked Unknown Side Effects

Not all side effects are created equal in the sense that they stem from a specific function call.
Consider R's basic [`graphics`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/graphics/) which
implicitly draws on the current device and does not explicitly link a function like `points` to the last call opening a new graphic device. In such a scenario, we use a linked side effect to mark the relation:

The analysis required _2.2 ms_ (including parse and normalize, using the [tree-sitter](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Engines) engine) within the generation environment. 
We encountered unknown side effects (with ids: 3 (linked)) during the analysis.


```r
plot(data)
points(data2)
```

Such side effects are not marked explicitly (with a big edge) but they are part of the unknown side effects: [3 (linked)].
Additionally, we express this by a [`reads`](#reads) edge.

If you are interested in which features we support and which features are still to be worked on, please refer to our [capabilities](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Capabilities) page.

<h3 id="dfg-resolving-values">Resolving Values</h3>

FlowR supports a [configurable](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Interface#configuring-flowr) level of value tracking&mdash;all with the goal of knowing the static value domain of a variable.
These capabilities are exposed by the [resolve value Query](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Query-API#resolve-value-query) and backed by two important functions:

<a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/dataflow/eval/resolve/alias-tracking.ts#L143"><code><span title="Evaluates the value of a node in the set domain.  resolveIdToValue tries to resolve the value using the data it has been given.

If neither is provided the value cannot be resolved.  This function is also used by the Resolve V...">resolveIdToValue</span></code></a> provides an environment-sensitive (see <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/dataflow/environments/environment.ts#L128"><code><span title="An environment describes a ( scoped ) mapping of names to their definitions ( BuiltIns ).  First, yes, R stores its environments differently, potentially even with another differentiation between the baseenv, the emptyenv, and other default environments (see https://adv-r.hadley.nz/environments.html). Yet, during the dataflow analysis, we want sometimes to know more (static reference information )...">REnvironmentInformation</span></code></a>)
value resolution depending on if the environment is provided.
The idea of <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/dataflow/eval/resolve/alias-tracking.ts#L143"><code><span title="Evaluates the value of a node in the set domain.  resolveIdToValue tries to resolve the value using the data it has been given.

If neither is provided the value cannot be resolved.  This function is also used by the Resolve V...">resolveIdToValue</span></code></a> is to provide a compromise between precision and performance, to
be used _during_ and _after_ the core analysis. After the dataflow analysis completes, there are much more expensive queries possible (such as the resolution of the data frame shape, see the [Query API](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Query-API)).

Additionally, to <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/dataflow/eval/resolve/alias-tracking.ts#L143"><code><span title="Evaluates the value of a node in the set domain.  resolveIdToValue tries to resolve the value using the data it has been given.

If neither is provided the value cannot be resolved.  This function is also used by the Resolve V...">resolveIdToValue</span></code></a>, we offer the aforementioned <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/queries/catalog/call-context-query/identify-link-to-last-call-relation.ts#L93"><code><span title="Gets the value node of the specified argument in the given function call, if it exists and matches the allowed types.">getValueOfArgument</span></code></a> to retrieve the value of an argument in a function call.
Be aware, that this function is currently not optimized for speed, so if you frequently require the values of multiple arguments of the same function call, you may want to open [an issue](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/issues/new/choose) to request support for resolving
multiple arguments at once.

<h3 id="dfg-assess-edge">Assessing Edges</h3>

The [edges](#edges) of the dataflow graph use bitmasks to represent an edge with multiple types. While this compacts the representation greatly, it makes it
difficult to check whether a given edge is a read edge. 
Consider the following example:





```mermaid
flowchart LR
    1(["`#91;RSymbol#93; x
      (1)
      *1.7*`"])
    3[["`#91;RFunctionCall#93; print
      (3)
      *1.1-8*
    (1)`"]]
    built-in:print["`Built-In:
print`"]
    style built-in:print stroke:gray,fill:lightgray,stroke-width:2px,opacity:.8;
    3 -->|"reads, returns, argument"| 1
    linkStyle 0 stroke:teal,stroke-width:4.2px,stroke-opacity:.8
    3 -.->|"reads, calls"| built-in:print
    linkStyle 1 stroke:gray;
```

<summary style="color:gray">R Code of the Dataflow Graph</summary>

The analysis required _0.3 ms_ (including parse and normalize, using the [tree-sitter](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Engines) engine) within the generation environment. The following marks are used in the graph to highlight sub-parts (uses ids): {3->1}.
We encountered unknown side effects (with ids: 3 (linked)) during the analysis.


```r
print(x)
```



</details>



Retrieving the _types_ of the edge from the print call to its argument returns:
`73`&mdash;which is usually not very helpful.
You can use <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/dataflow/graph/edge.ts#L81"><code><span title="Takes joint edge types and splits them into their individual components.">splitEdgeTypes</span></code></a> to get the individual bitmasks of all included types, and 
<a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/dataflow/graph/edge.ts#L125"><code><span title="Check if the given-edge type has any of the given types.">edgeIncludesType</span></code></a> to check whether a specific type (or one of a collection of types) is included in the edge.

<h3 id="dfg-handling-origins">Handling Origins</h3>

If you are writing another analysis on top of the dataflow graph, you probably want to know all definitions that serve as the source of a read, all functions
that are called by an invocation, and more.

Their respective uses are documented alongside their implementation:

- <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/dataflow/origin/dfg-get-origin.ts#L18"><code>BuiltInFunctionOrigin</code></a>\
This is similar to a
<code>FunctionCallOrigin</code>
, but used for built-in functions that have no direct correspondence in the dataflow graph.
- <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/dataflow/origin/dfg-get-origin.ts#L17"><code>FunctionCallOrigin</code></a>\
Determines the (transitive) origin of a function call (i.e., all anonymous function definitions within the program that
can be called).
- <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/dataflow/origin/dfg-get-origin.ts#L35"><code><span title="An origin that indicates that the definition is read, written, or simply a constant. These origins only reference the 'direct' dependencies. There is no transitivity.">SimpleOrigin</span></code></a>\
An origin that indicates that the definition is read, written, or simply a constant.
These origins only reference the 'direct' dependencies. There is no transitivity.

Please note, the current structure of this function is biased by what implementations already exist in flowR.
Hence, we do not just track definitions and constants, but also the origins of function calls, albeit we do not yet track the origins of values (only resorting to
a constant origin). If you are confused by this please start a discussion&mdash;in a way we are still deciding on a good API for this.
