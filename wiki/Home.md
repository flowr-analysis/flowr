_flowR_ is a static [dataflow analyzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-flow_analysis) and [program slicer](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Terminology#program-slice) for the [_R_](https://www.r-project.org/) programming language (currently tested for versions `4.x` and `3.6.x`), and you have stumbled upon its wiki pages!

Overall, this wiki has three goals:

1. Illustrate how to [**use**](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Overview) _flowR_.
2. Show how to [**extend**](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Interface) _flowR_ with other tools (i.e., how to interface with _flowR_)
3. Explain the inner workings to help to [**develop**](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Core) _flowR_'s core.

Hence, depending on your needs and interest, only a subset of the wiki pages may be of further interest to you.
Nevertheless, we highly recommend you start your journey by reading the [Overview](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Overview) wiki page, which explains the main features of _flowR_ and how to use them.

For the integrations of _flowR_, please refer to the respective repositories:

- The [Visual Studio Code extension](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/vscode-flowr)
- The [RStudio Addin](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/rstudio-addin-flowr)
- The [R package](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr-r-adapter)
- The [Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/eagleoutice/flowr)
