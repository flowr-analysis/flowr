Please do not edit this file/wiki page directly._

Although far from being as detailed as the in-depth explanation of
[_flowR_](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki//Core),
this wiki page explains how to interface with _flowR_ in more detail.
In general, command line arguments and other options provide short descriptions on hover over.

## 💬 Communicating with the Server


As explained in the [Overview](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki//Overview), you can simply run the [TCP](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol)&nbsp;server by adding the <span title="Description (Command Line Argument): Do not drop into a repl, but instead start a server on the given port (default: 1042) and listen for messages.">`--server`</span> flag (and, due to the interactive mode, exit with the conventional <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>).
Currently, every connection is handled by the same underlying `RShell` - so the server is not designed to handle many clients at a time.
Additionally, the server is not well guarded against attacks (e.g., you can theoretically spawn an arbitrary number of&nbsp;RShell sessions on the target machine).

Every message has to be given in a single line (i.e., without a newline in-between) and end with a newline character. Nevertheless, we will pretty-print example given in the following segments for the ease of reading.


> [!NOTE]
> 
> The default <span title="Description (Command Line Argument): Do not drop into a repl, but instead start a server on the given port (default: 1042) and listen for messages.">`--server`</span> uses a simple [TCP](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol)
> connection. If you want _flowR_ to expose a [WebSocket](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) server instead, add the <span title="Description (Command Line Argument): If the server flag is set, use websocket for messaging">`--ws`</span> flag (i.e., <span title="Description (Command Line Argument): Do not drop into a repl, but instead start a server on the given port (default: 1042) and listen for messages.">`--server`</span> <span title="Description (Command Line Argument): If the server flag is set, use websocket for messaging">`--ws`</span>) when starting _flowR_ from the command line.

    Server->>Client: hello
	
```


	
After launching _flowR_, for example, with <code>docker run -it --rm eagleoutice/flowr <span title="Description (Command Line Argument): Do not drop into a repl, but instead start a server on the given port (default: 1042) and listen for messages.">-<span/>-server</span></code>&nbsp;(🐳️), simply connecting should present you with a `hello` message, that amongst others should reveal the versions of&nbsp;_flowR_ and&nbsp;R, using the [semver 2.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) versioning scheme.
The message looks like this:


```json
{
  "type": "hello",
  "clientName": "client-0",
  "versions": {
    "flowr": "2.2.1",
    "r": "4.4.0",
    "engine": "r-shell"
  }
}
```


There are currently a few messages that you can send after the hello message.
If you want to _slice_ a piece of R code you first have to send an [analysis request](#message-request-file-analysis), so that you can send one or multiple slice requests afterward.
Requests for the [REPL](#message-request-repl) are independent of that.

<details>
<summary style="color:gray">Message schema (<code>hello</code>)</summary>

For the definition of the hello message, please see it's implementation at [`./src/cli/repl/server/messages/message-hello.ts`](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main/./src/cli/repl/server/messages/message-hello.ts).

- **.** object [required]
    - **type** string [required]
        _The type of the hello message._
        Allows only the values: 'hello'
    - **id** any [forbidden]
        _The id of the message is always undefined (as it is the initial message and not requested)._
    - **clientName** string [required]
        _A unique name that is assigned to each client. It has no semantic meaning and is only used/useful for debugging._
    - **versions** object [required]
        - **flowr** string [required]
            _The version of the flowr server running in semver format._
        - **r** string [required]
            _The version of the underlying R shell running in semver format._
        - **engine** string [required]
            _The parser backend that is used to parse the R code._

<b>Analysis</b> Message (<code>request-file-analysis</code>)

    end
    deactivate  Server
	
```


	
The request allows the server to analyze a file and prepare it for slicing.
The message can contain a `filetoken`, which is used to identify the file in later slice or lineage requests (if you do not add one, the request will not be stored and therefore, it is not available for subsequent requests).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you want to send and process a lot of analysis requests, but do not want to slice them, please do not pass the `filetoken` field. This will save the server a lot of memory allocation.

Furthermore, the request must contain either a `content` field to directly pass the file's content or a `filepath` field which contains the path to the file (this path must be accessible for the server to be useful).
If you add the `id` field, the answer will use the same `id` so you can match requests and the corresponding answers.
See the implementation of the request-file-analysis message for more information.


<details>
<summary>Example of the <code>request-file-analysis</code> Message</summary>

_Note:_ even though we pretty-print these messages, they are sent as a single line, ending with a newline.

The following lists all messages that were sent and received in case you want to reproduce the scenario:

<ol>
<li> <code>hello</code> (response)
<details> 

<summary> Show Details </summary>

The first message is always a hello message.




```json
{
  "type": "hello",
  "clientName": "client-0",
  "versions": {
    "flowr": "2.2.1",
    "r": "4.4.0",
    "engine": "r-shell"
  }
}
```



</details>
</li>

<li> <b><code>request-file-analysis</code> (request)</b>
<details open> 

<summary> Show Details </summary>

Let' suppose you simply want to analyze the following script:
 
```r
x <- 1
x + 1
```

 For this, you can send the following request:




```json
{
  "type": "request-file-analysis",
  "id": "1",
  "filetoken": "x",
  "content": "x <- 1\nx + 1"
}
```



</details>
</li>

<li> <code>response-file-analysis</code> (response)
<details> 

<summary> Show Details </summary>



The `results` field of the response effectively contains three keys of importance:

- `parse`: which contains 1:1 the parse result in CSV format that we received from the `RShell` (i.e., the AST produced by the parser of the R interpreter).
- `normalize`: which contains the normalized AST, including ids (see the `info` field and the [Normalized AST](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki//Normalized%20AST) wiki page).
- `dataflow`: especially important is the `graph` field which contains the dataflow graph as a set of root vertices (see the [Dataflow Graph](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki//Dataflow%20Graph) wiki page).
			


_As the code is pretty long, we inhibit pretty printing and syntax highlighting (JSON):_

You receive an error if, for whatever reason, the analysis fails (e.g., the message or code you sent contained syntax errors).
It contains a human-readable description *why* the analysis failed (see the error message implementation for more details).

<summary>Example Error Message</summary>

_Note:_ even though we pretty-print these messages, they are sent as a single line, ending with a newline.

The following lists all messages that were sent and received in case you want to reproduce the scenario:

The first message is always a hello message.

**Including the Control Flow Graph**

While _flowR_ does (for the time being) not use an explicit control flow graph but instead relies on control-dependency edges within the dataflow graph, 
the respective structure can still be exposed using the server (note that, as this feature is not needed within _flowR_, it is tested significantly less - 
so please create a [new issue](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/issues/new/choose) for any bug you may encounter).
For this, the analysis request may add `cfg: true` to its list of options.

**Retrieve the Output as RDF N-Quads**

The default response is formatted as JSON.
However, by specifying `format: "n-quads"`, you can retrieve the individual results (e.g., the [Normalized AST](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki//Normalized%20AST)),
as [RDF N-Quads](https://www.w3.org/TR/n-quads/).
This works with and without the control flow graph as described [above](#analysis-include-cfg).


<details>
<summary>Requesting RDF N-Quads</summary>

_Note:_ even though we pretty-print these messages, they are sent as a single line, ending with a newline.

The following lists all messages that were sent and received in case you want to reproduce the scenario:

<ol>
<li> <code>hello</code> (response)
<details> 

<summary> Show Details </summary>

The first message is always a hello message.




```json
{
  "type": "hello",
  "clientName": "client-0",
  "versions": {
    "flowr": "2.2.1",
    "r": "4.4.0",
    "engine": "r-shell"
  }
}
```



</details>
</li>

<li> <b><code>request-file-analysis</code> (request)</b>
<details open> 

<summary> Show Details </summary>






```json
{
  "type": "request-file-analysis",
  "id": "1",
  "filetoken": "x",
  "content": "x <- 1\nx + 1",
  "format": "n-quads",
  "cfg": true
}
```



</details>
</li>

<li> <code>response-file-analysis</code> (response)
<details> 

<summary> Show Details </summary>


Please note, that the base message format is still JSON. Only the individual results get converted. 
While the context is derived from the `filename`, we currently offer no way to customize other parts of the quads 
(please open a [new issue](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/issues/new/choose) if you require this).
			


_As the code is pretty long, we inhibit pretty printing and syntax highlighting (JSON):_

**We deprecated the slice request in favor of the `static-slice` [Query](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki//Query%20API).**

To slice, you have to send a file analysis request first. The `filetoken` you assign is of use here as you can re-use it to repeatedly slice the same file.
Besides that, you only need to add an array of slicing criteria, using one of the formats described on the [terminology wiki page](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki//Terminology#slicing-criterion) 
(however, instead of using `;`, you can simply pass separate array elements).
See the implementation of the request-slice message for more information.

Additionally, you may pass `"noMagicComments": true` to disable the automatic selection of elements based on magic comments (see below).


<details>
<summary>Example of the <code>request-slice</code> Message</summary>

_Note:_ even though we pretty-print these messages, they are sent as a single line, ending with a newline.

The following lists all messages that were sent and received in case you want to reproduce the scenario:

<ol>
<li> <code>hello</code> (response)
<details> 

<summary> Show Details </summary>

The first message is always a hello message.




```json
{
  "type": "hello",
  "clientName": "client-0",
  "versions": {
    "flowr": "2.2.1",
    "r": "4.4.0",
    "engine": "r-shell"
  }
}
```



</details>
</li>

<li> <code>request-file-analysis</code> (request)
<details> 

<summary> Show Details </summary>

Let's assume you want to slice the following script:

```r
x <- 1
x + 1
```


For this we first request the analysis, using a `filetoken` of `x` to slice the file in the next request.




```json
{
  "type": "request-file-analysis",
  "id": "1",
  "filetoken": "x",
  "content": "x <- 1\nx + 1"
}
```



</details>
</li>

<li> <code>response-file-analysis</code> (response)
<details> 

<summary> Show Details </summary>


See [above](#message-request-file-analysis) for the general structure of the response.

Of course, the second slice criterion `2:1` is redundant for the input, as they refer to the same variable. It is only for demonstration purposes.




```json
{
  "type": "request-slice",
  "id": "2",

The `results` field of the response contains two keys of importance:

- `slice`: which contains the result of the slicing (e.g., the ids included in the slice in `result`).
- `reconstruct`: contains the reconstructed code, as well as additional meta information. 
                   The automatically selected lines correspond to additional filters (e.g., magic comments) which force the unconditiojnal inclusion of certain elements.





```json
{
  "type": "response-slice",
  "id": "2",
  "results": {
    "slice": {
      "timesHitThreshold": 0,
      "result": [

The semantics of the error message are similar. If, for example, the slicing criterion is invalid or the `filetoken` is unknown, _flowR_ will respond with an error.

&nbsp;

<a id="slice-magic-comments"></a>
**Magic Comments**


Within a document that is to be sliced, you can use magic comments to influence the slicing process:

- `# flowr@include_next_line` will cause the next line to be included, independent of if it is important for the slice.
- `# flowr@include_this_line` will cause the current line to be included, independent of if it is important for the slice.
- `# flowr@include_start` and `# flowr@include_end` will cause the lines between them to be included, independent of if they are important for the slice. These magic comments can be nested but should appear on a separate line.

> [!WARNING]

The REPL execution message allows to send a REPL command to receive its output. 
For more on the REPL, see the [introduction](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki//Overview#the-read-eval-print-loop-repl), or the [description below](#using-the-repl).
You only have to pass the command you want to execute in the `expression` field. 
Furthermore, you can set the `ansi` field to `true` if you are interested in output formatted using [ANSI escape codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code).
We strongly recommend you to make use of the `id` field to link answers with requests as you can theoretically request the execution of multiple scripts at the same time, which then happens in parallel.

> [!WARNING]
> There is currently no automatic sandboxing or safeguarding against such requests. They simply execute the respective&nbsp;R code on your machine. 
> Please be very careful (and do not use <span title="Description (Command Line Argument): Allow to access the underlying R session when using flowR (security warning: this allows the execution of arbitrary R code!)">`--r-session-access`</span> if you are unsure).


The answer on such a request is different from the other messages as the `response-repl-execution` message may be sent multiple times. 
This allows to better handle requests that require more time but already output intermediate results.
You can detect the end of the execution by receiving the `end-repl-execution` message.

The semantics of the error message are similar to that of the other messages.

<summary>Example of the <code>request-slice</code> Message</summary>

_Note:_ even though we pretty-print these messages, they are sent as a single line, ending with a newline.

The following lists all messages that were sent and received in case you want to reproduce the scenario:

<ol>
<li> <code>hello</code> (response)
<details> 

<summary> Show Details </summary>

The first message is always a hello message.




```json
{
  "type": "hello",
  "clientName": "client-0",
  "versions": {
    "flowr": "2.2.1",
    "r": "4.4.0",

<summary>Pretty-Printed Result</summary>


```text
If enabled ('--r-session-access'), you can just enter R expressions which get evaluated right away:
R> 1 + 1
[1] 2

Besides that, you can use the following commands. The scripts can accept further arguments. In general, those ending with [*] may be called with and without the star. 
There are the following basic commands:
  :controlflow[*]  Get mermaid code for the control-flow graph of R code, start with 'file://' to indicate a file (star: Returns the URL to mermaid.live) (aliases: :cfg, :cf)
  :dataflow[*]     Get mermaid code for the dataflow graph of R code, start with 'file://' to indicate a file (star: Returns the URL to mermaid.live) (aliases: :d, :df)
  :execute         Execute the given code as R code (essentially similar to using now command). This requires the `--r-session-access` flag to be set and requires the r-shell engine. (aliases: :e, :r)
  :help            Show help information (aliases: :h, :?)
  :lineage         Get the lineage of an R object (alias: :lin)
  :normalize[*]    Get mermaid code for the normalized AST of R code, start with 'file://' to indicate a file (star: Returns the URL to mermaid.live) (alias: :n)
  :parse           Prints ASCII Art of the parsed, unmodified AST, start with 'file://' to indicate a file (alias: :p)
  :query[*]        Query the given R code, start with 'file://' to indicate a file. The query is to be a valid query in json format (use 'help' to get more information). (star: Similar to query, but returns the output in json format.)
  :quit            End the repl (aliases: :q, :exit)
  :version         Prints the version of flowR as well as the current version of R

Furthermore, you can directly call the following scripts which accept arguments. If you are unsure, try to add --help after the command.
  :benchmark       Benchmark the static backwards slicer
  :export-quads    Export quads of the normalized AST of a given R code file
  :slicer          Static backwards executable slicer for R
  :stats           Generate usage Statistics for R scripts
  :summarizer      Summarize the results of the benchmark

You can combine commands by separating them with a semicolon ;.

To send queries, you have to send an [analysis request](#message-request-file-analysis) first. The `filetoken` you assign is of use here as you can re-use it to repeatedly query the same file.
This message provides direct access to _flowR_'s Query API. Please consult the [Query API documentation](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki//Query%20API) for more information.


<details>
<summary>Example of the <code>request-query</code> Message</summary>

_Note:_ even though we pretty-print these messages, they are sent as a single line, ending with a newline.

The following lists all messages that were sent and received in case you want to reproduce the scenario:

<ol>
<li> <code>hello</code> (response)
<details> 

<summary> Show Details </summary>

The first message is always a hello message.




```json
{
  "type": "hello",
  "clientName": "client-0",
  "versions": {
    "flowr": "2.2.1",
    "r": "4.4.0",
    "engine": "r-shell"
  }
}
```



</details>
</li>

<li> <code>request-file-analysis</code> (request)
<details> 

<summary> Show Details </summary>

Let's assume you want to query the following script:

```r
library(ggplot)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)

# read data with read_csv
data <- read_csv('data.csv')
data2 <- read_csv('data2.csv')

m <- mean(data$x) 
print(m)

data %>%
	ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) +
	geom_point()
	
plot(data2$x, data2$y)
points(data2$x, data2$y)
	
print(mean(data2$k))
```
.

For this we first request the analysis, using a dummy `filetoken` of `x` to slice the file in the next request.




```json
{
  "type": "request-file-analysis",
  "id": "1",
  "filetoken": "x",
  "content": "library(ggplot)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(readr)\n\n# read data with read_csv\ndata <- read_csv('data.csv')\ndata2 <- read_csv('data2.csv')\n\nm <- mean(data$x) \nprint(m)\n\ndata %>%\n\tggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) +\n\tgeom_point()\n\t\nplot(data2$x, data2$y)\npoints(data2$x, data2$y)\n\t\nprint(mean(data2$k))"
}
```

**We deprecated the lineage request in favor of the `lineage` [Query](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki//Query%20API).**

In order to retrieve the lineage of an object, you have to send a file analysis request first. The `filetoken` you assign is of use here as you can re-use it to repeatedly retrieve the lineage of the same file.
Besides that, you will need to add a [criterion](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki//Terminology#slicing-criterion) that specifies the object whose lineage you're interested in.

### 📡 Ways of Connecting

If you are interested in clients that communicate with _flowR_, please check out the [R adapter](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr-r-adapter)
as well as the [Visual Studio Code extension](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/vscode-flowr). 

<ol>

<li>
<a id="using-netcat-without-websocket"></a>Using Netcat

<details>

<summary>Without Websocket</summary>

Suppose, you want to launch the server using a docker container. Then, start the server by (forwarding the internal default port):


```shell
docker run -p1042:1042 -it --rm eagleoutice/flowr --server
```


Now, using a tool like [_netcat_](https://linux.die.net/man/1/nc) to connect:


```shell
nc 127.0.0.1 1042
```


Within the started session, type the following message (as a single line) and press enter to see the response:


```json
{"type":"request-file-analysis","content":"x <- 1","id":"1"}
```


</details>
</li>

<li> Using Python
<details>
<summary>Without Websocket</summary>

In Python, a similar process would look like this. After starting the server as with using [netcat](#using-netcat-without-websocket), you can use the following script to connect:


```python
import socket

with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:
    s.connect(('127.0.0.1', 1042))
    print(s.recv(4096))  # for the hello message

    s.send(b'{"type":"request-file-analysis","content":"x <- 1","id":"1"}\n')

    print(s.recv(65536))  # for the response (please use a more sophisticated mechanism)
```

## 💻 Using the REPL


> [!NOTE]
> To execute arbitrary R commands with a repl request, _flowR_ has to be started explicitly with <span title="Description (Command Line Argument): Allow to access the underlying R session when using flowR (security warning: this allows the execution of arbitrary R code!)">`--r-session-access`</span>.
> Please be aware that this introduces a security risk and note that this relies on the [`r-shell` engine](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki//Engines).


Although primarily meant for users to explore, 
there is nothing which forbids simply calling _flowR_ as a subprocess to use standard-in, -output, and -error 
for communication (although you can access the REPL using the server as well, 
with the [REPL Request](#message-request-repl-execution) message).

The read-eval-print loop&nbsp;(REPL) works relatively simple.
You can submit an expression (using enter),
which is interpreted as an R&nbsp;expression by default but interpreted as a *command* if it starts with a colon (`:`).
The best command to get started with the REPL is <span title="Description (Repl Command): Show help information (aliases: :h, :?)">`:help`</span>.
Besides, you can leave the REPL either with the command <span title="Description (Repl Command): End the repl (aliases: :q, :exit)">`:quit`</span> or by pressing <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> twice.


<details>
<summary>Available Commands</summary>

We currently offer the following commands (this with a `[*]` suffix are available with and without the star):

### Example: Retrieving the Dataflow Graph

To retrieve a URL to the [mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) diagram of the dataflow of a given expression, 
use <span title="Description (Repl Command, starred version): Returns the URL to mermaid.live; Base Command: Get mermaid code for the dataflow graph of R code, start with 'file://' to indicate a file (aliases: :d*, :df*)">`:dataflow*`</span> (or <span title="Description (Repl Command): Get mermaid code for the dataflow graph of R code, start with 'file://' to indicate a file (aliases: :d, :df)">`:dataflow`</span> to get the mermaid code in the cli):



```shell
docker run -it --rm eagleoutice/flowr
R> :dataflow* y <- 1 + x
```

<details>
<summary style='color:gray'>Output</summary>

Retrieve the dataflow graph of the expression `y <- 1 + x`. It looks like this:

For the slicing with <span title="Description (Repl Command): Static backwards executable slicer for R">`:slicer`</span>, you have access to the same [magic comments](#slice-magic-comments) as with the [slice request](#message-request-slice).

### Example: Interfacing with the File System

Many commands that allow for an R-expression (like <span title="Description (Repl Command, starred version): Returns the URL to mermaid.live; Base Command: Get mermaid code for the dataflow graph of R code, start with 'file://' to indicate a file (aliases: :d*, :df*)">`:dataflow*`</span>) allow for a file as well 
if the argument starts with `file://`. 
If you are working from the root directory of the _flowR_ repository, the following gives you the parsed AST of the example file using the <span title="Description (Repl Command): Prints ASCII Art of the parsed, unmodified AST, start with 'file://' to indicate a file (aliases: :p)">`:parse`</span> command:



```shell
docker run -it --rm eagleoutice/flowr
R> :parse file://test/testfiles/example.R
```

<details>
<summary style='color:gray'>Output</summary>

Retrieve the parsed AST of the example file.

<details>

<summary>File Content</summary>	


```r
sum <- 0
product <- 1
w <- 7
N <- 10

for (i in 1:(N-1)) {
  sum <- sum + i + w
  product <- product * i
}

cat("Sum:", sum, "\n")
cat("Product:", product, "\n")
```


</details>

As _flowR_ directly transforms this AST the output focuses on being human-readable instead of being machine-readable.

## ⚙️ Configuring FlowR



When running _flowR_, you may want to specify some behaviors with a dedicated configuration file. 
By default, flowR looks for a file named `flowr.json` in the current working directory (or any higher directory). 
You can also specify a different file with <span title="Description (Command Line Argument): The name of the configuration file to use">`--config-file`</span> or pass the configuration inline using <span title="Description (Command Line Argument): The flowR configuration to use, as a JSON string">`--config-json`</span>.
To inspect the current configuration, you can run flowr with the <span title="Description (Command Line Argument): Run with verbose logging (will be passed to the corresponding script)">`--verbose`</span> flag, or use the `config` [Query](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki//Query%20API).
Within the REPL this works by running the following:


```shell
:query @config
```


The following summarizes the configuration options:

- `ignoreSourceCalls`: If set to `true`, _flowR_ will ignore source calls when analyzing the code, i.e., ignoring the inclusion of other files.
- `rPath`: The path to the R executable. If not set, _flowR_ will try to find the R executable in the system's PATH.
- `semantics`: allows to configure the way _flowR_ handles R, although we currently only support `semantics/environment/overwriteBuiltIns`. 
  You may use this to overwrite _flowR_'s handling of built-in function and even completely clear the preset definitions shipped with flowR. 
  See [Configure BuiltIn Semantics](#configure-builtin-semantics) for more information.
- `solver`: allows to configure how _flowR_ resolves variables and their values (currently we support: `disabled`, `alias`, `builtin`), as well as if pointer analysis should be active.
- `engines`: allows to configure the engines used by _flowR_ to interact with R code. See the [Engines wiki page](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki//Engines) for more information.
- `defaultEngine`: allows to specify the default engine to use for interacting with R code. If not set, an arbitrary engine from the specified list will be used.

So you can configure _flowR_ by adding a file like the following:

<details>

<summary>Example Configuration File</summary>


```json
{
  "ignoreSourceCalls": true,
  "rPath": "/usr/bin/R",
  "semantics": {
    "environment": {
      "overwriteBuiltIns": {
        "definitions": [
          {
            "type": "function",
            "names": [
              "foo"
            ],
            "processor": "builtin:assignment",
            "config": {}
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  },
  "engines": [
    {
      "type": "r-shell"
    }
  ],
  "solver": {
    "variables": "alias",
    "pointerTracking": true
  }
}
```

<summary>Configure Built-In Semantics</summary> 


`semantics/environment/overwriteBuiltins` accepts two keys:

- `loadDefaults` (boolean, initially `true`): If set to `true`, the default built-in definitions are loaded before applying the custom definitions. Setting this flag to `false` explicitly disables the loading of the default definitions.
- `definitions` (array, initially empty): Allows to overwrite or define new built-in elements. Each object within must have a `type` which is one of the below. Furthermore, they may define a string array of `names` which specifies the identifiers to bind the definitions to. You may use `assumePrimitive` to specify whether _flowR_ should assume that this is a primitive non-library definition (so you probably just do not want to specify the key).

  | Type            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Example                                                                                                    |
  | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `constant`    | Additionally allows for a `value` this should resolve to.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | `{ type: 'constant', names: ['NULL', 'NA'],  value: null }`                                                |
  | `function`    | Is a rather flexible way to define and bind built-in functions. For the time, we do not have extensive documentation to cover all the cases, so please either consult the sources with the `default-builtin-config.ts` or open a [new issue](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/issues/new/choose). | `{ type: 'function', names: ['next'], processor: 'builtin:default', config: { cfg: ExitPointType.Next } }` |
  | `replacement` | A comfortable way to specify replacement functions like `$<-` or `names<-`. `suffixes` describes the... suffixes to attach automatically. | `{ type: 'replacement', suffixes: ['<-', '<<-'], names: ['[', '[['] }` |

## ⚒️ Writing Code


_flowR_ can be used as a [module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@eagleoutice/flowr) and offers several main classes and interfaces that are interesting for extension writers 
(see the [Visual Studio Code extension](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/vscode-flowr) or the [core](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki//Core) wiki page for more information).

The [<code><span title="The RShell represents an interactive session with the R interpreter. You can configure it by RShellOptions .  At the moment we are using a live R session (and not networking etc.) to communicate with R easily, which allows us to install packages etc. However, this might and probably will change in the future (leaving this as a legacy mode :D)">RShell</span></code>](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/r-bridge/shell.ts#L140) class allows interfacing with the `R`&nbsp;ecosystem installed on the host system.
Please have a look at [flowR's engines](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki//Engines) for more information on alterantives.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Each [<code><span title="The RShell represents an interactive session with the R interpreter. You can configure it by RShellOptions .  At the moment we are using a live R session (and not networking etc.) to communicate with R easily, which allows us to install packages etc. However, this might and probably will change in the future (leaving this as a legacy mode :D)">RShell</span></code>](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/r-bridge/shell.ts#L140) controls a new instance of the R&nbsp;interpreter, make sure to call <code>[<span title="The RShell represents an interactive session with the R interpreter.

You can start a new "session" simply by constructing a new object with <code>new [<span title="The RShell represents an interactive session with the R interpreter. You can configure it by RShellOptions .  At the moment we are using a live R session (and not networking etc.) to communicate with R easily, which allows us to install packages etc. However, this might and probably will change in the future (leaving this as a legacy mode :D)">RShell</span>](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/r-bridge/shell.ts#L140)()</code>.

However, there are several options that may be of interest (e.g., to automatically revive the shell in case of errors or to control the name location of the R process on the system).

With a shell object (let's call it `shell`), you can execute R code by using <code>[<span title="The RShell represents an interactive session with the R interpreter. You can configure it by RShellOptions .  At the moment we are using a live R session (and not networking etc.) to communicate with R easily, which allows us to install packages etc. However, this might and probably will change in the future (leaving this as a legacy mode :D)">RShell</span>](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/r-bridge/shell.ts#L140)::sendCommand</code>, 
for example `shell.sendCommand("1 + 1")`. 
However, this does not return anything, so if you want to collect the output of your command, use <code>[<span title="The RShell represents an interactive session with the R interpreter. You can configure it by RShellOptions .  At the moment we are using a live R session (and not networking etc.) to communicate with R easily, which allows us to install packages etc. However, this might and probably will change in the future (leaving this as a legacy mode :D)">RShell</span>](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/r-bridge/shell.ts#L140)::sendCommandWithOutput</code> instead.

Besides that, the command <code>[<span title="The RShell represents an interactive session with the R interpreter. You can configure it by RShellOptions .  At the moment we are using a live R session (and not networking etc.) to communicate with R easily, which allows us to install packages etc. However, this might and probably will change in the future (leaving this as a legacy mode :D)">RShell</span>](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/r-bridge/shell.ts#L140)::tryToInjectHomeLibPath</code> may be of interest, as it enables all libraries available on the host system.

### The Pipeline Executor

Once, in the beginning, _flowR_ was meant to produce a dataflow graph merely to provide *program slices*. 
However, with continuous updates, the [dataflow graph](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki//Dataflow%20Graph) repeatedly proves to be the more interesting part.
With this, we restructured _flowR_'s originally *hardcoded* pipeline to be far more flexible. 
Now, it can be theoretically extended or replaced with arbitrary steps, optional steps, and what we call 'decorations' of these steps. 
In short, if you still "just want to slice" you can do it like this with the [<code><span title="The pipeline executor allows to execute arbitrary pipelines in a step-by-step fashion. If you are not yet in the possession of a pipeline , you can use the createPipeline function to create one for yourself, based on the steps that you want to execute.

```ts
const slicer = new PipelineExecutor(DEFAULT_SLICING_PIPELINE, {
  parser:    new RShell(),
  request:   requestFromInput('x <- 1\nx + 1'),
  criterion: ['2@x']
})
const slice = await slicer.allRemainingSteps()
// console.log(slice.reconstruct.code)
```

If you compare this, with what you would have done with the old (and removed) `SteppingSlicer`, 
this essentially just requires you to replace the `SteppingSlicer` with the [<code><span title="The pipeline executor allows to execute arbitrary pipelines in a step-by-step fashion.

and to pass the [<code>DEFAULT_SLICING_PIPELINE</code>](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/core/steps/pipeline/default-pipelines.ts#L16) as the first argument.

1. allows investigating the results of all intermediate steps
2. Can be executed step-by-step
3. Can repeat steps (e.g., to calculate multiple slices on the same input)

<summary>Adding a New Feature to Extract</summary>

In this example, we construct a new feature to extract, with the name "*example*".
Whenever this name appears, you may substitute this with whatever name fits your feature best (as long as the name is unique).

1. **Create a new file in `src/statistics/features/supported`**\
   Create the file `example.ts`, and add its export to the `index.ts` file in the same directory (if not done automatically).

2. **Create the basic structure**\
   To get a better feel of what a feature must have, let's look
   at the basic structure (of course, due to TypeScript syntax,
   there are other ways to achieve the same goal):

   ```ts
   const initialExampleInfo = {
       /* whatever start value is good for you */
       someCounter: 0
   }

   export type ExampleInfo = Writable<typeof initialExampleInfo>

   export const example: Feature<ExampleInfo> = {
    name:        'Example Feature',
    description: 'A longer example description',

    process(existing: ExampleInfo, input: FeatureProcessorInput): ExampleInfo {
      /* perform analysis on the input */
      return existing
    },

    initialValue: initialExampleInfo
   }
   ```

   The `initialExampleInfo` type holds the initial values for each counter that you want to maintain during the feature extraction (they will usually be initialized with 0). The resulting `ExampleInfo` type holds the structure of the data that is to be counted. Due to the vast amount of data processed, information like the name and location of a function call is not stored here, but instead written to disk (see below).

   Every new feature must be of the `Feature<Info>` type, with `Info` referring to a `FeatureInfo` (like `ExampleInfo` in this example). Next to a `name` and a `description`, each Feature must provide:

   - a processor that extracts the information from the input, adding it to the existing information.
   - a function returning the initial value of the information (in this case, `initialExampleInfo`).

3. **Add it to the feature-mapping**\
   Now, in the `feature.ts` file in `src/statistics/features`, add your feature to the `ALL_FEATURES` object.

Now, we want to extract something. For the *example* feature created in the previous steps, we choose to count the amount of `COMMENT` tokens.
So we define a corresponding [XPath](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XPath) query:

```ts
const commentQuery: Query = xpath.parse('//COMMENT')
```

Within our feature's `process` function, running the query is as simple as:

```ts
const comments = commentQuery.select({ node: input.parsedRAst })
```

Now we could do a lot of further processing, but for simplicity, we only record every comment found this way:

```ts
appendStatisticsFile(example.name, 'comments', comments, input.filepath)
```

We use `example.name` to avoid duplication with the name that we’ve assigned to the feature. It corresponds to the name of the folder in the statistics output.
`'comments'` refers to a freely chosen (but unique) name, that will be used as the name for the output file within the folder. The `comments` variable holds the result of the query, which is an array of nodes. Finally, we pass the `filepath` of the file that was analyzed (if known), so that it can be added to the statistics file (as additional information).
