_This document was generated from '[src/documentation/print-linter-wiki.ts](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/documentation/print-linter-wiki.ts)' on 2025-06-02, 21:03:49 UTC presenting an overview of flowR's linter (v2.2.14, using R v4.4.3). Please do not edit this file/wiki page directly._

This page describes the flowR linter, which is a tool that utilizes flowR's dataflow analysis to find common issues in R scripts. The linter can currently be used through the linter [query](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Query%20API).

## Linting Rules

The following linting rules are available:

### Deprecated Functions (`deprecated-functions`)
	
This rule detects the usage of deprecated functions in code based on a predefined list of known deprecated functions.

<details>

#### Configuration

Linting rules can be configured by passing a configuration object to the linter query as shown in the example below. The `deprecated-functions` rule accepts the following configuration options:

- [<code><span title="The list of function names that should be marked as deprecated.">deprecatedFunctions</span></code>](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/linter/rules/1-deprecated-functions.ts#L19)\
The list of function names that should be marked as deprecated.

#### Example


```r
first <- data.frame(x = c(1, 2, 3), y = c(1, 2, 3))
second <- data.frame(x = c(1, 3, 2), y = c(1, 3, 2))
dplyr::all_equal(first, second)
```


The linting query can be used to run this rule on the above example:




```json
[ { "type": "linter",   "rules": [ { "name": "deprecated-functions",     "config": {} } ] } ]
```




_Results (prettified and summarized):_

Query: **linter** (2 ms)\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;╰ deprecated-functions:\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;╰ _Metadata_: <code>{"totalRelevant":9,"totalNotDeprecated":9,"searchTimeMs":0,"processTimeMs":1}</code>\
_All queries together required ≈2 ms (1ms accuracy, total 25 ms)_

<details> <summary style="color:gray">Show Detailed Results as Json</summary>

The analysis required _25.4 ms_ (including parsing and normalization and the query) within the generation environment.	

In general, the JSON contains the Ids of the nodes in question as they are present in the normalized AST or the dataflow graph of flowR.
Please consult the [Interface](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Interface) wiki page for more information on how to get those.




```json
{
  "linter": {
    "results": {
      "deprecated-functions": {
        "results": [],
        ".meta": {
          "totalRelevant": 9,
          "totalNotDeprecated": 9,
          "searchTimeMs": 0,

        }

  },

### File Path Validity (`file-path-validity`)
	
This rule finds places in the code where files are being read from. In such places, it checks whether the file path is valid and whether the file exists on disk.

<details>

#### Configuration

Linting rules can be configured by passing a configuration object to the linter query as shown in the example below. The `file-path-validity` rule accepts the following configuration options:

- [<code><span title="The set of functions that should additionally be considered as reading a file path. Entries in this array use the FunctionInfo format from the dependencies query.">additionalReadFunctions</span></code>](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/linter/rules/2-file-path-validity.ts#L32)\
The set of functions that should additionally be considered as reading a file path.
Entries in this array use the
<code>FunctionInfo</code>
format from the dependencies query.
- [<code><span title="The set of functions that should additionally be considered as writing to a file path. Entries in this array use the FunctionInfo format from the dependencies query.">additionalWriteFunctions</span></code>](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/linter/rules/2-file-path-validity.ts#L37)\
The set of functions that should additionally be considered as writing to a file path.
Entries in this array use the
<code>FunctionInfo</code>
format from the dependencies query.
- [<code><span title="Whether unknown file paths should be included as linting results.">includeUnknown</span></code>](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/linter/rules/2-file-path-validity.ts#L41)\
Whether unknown file paths should be included as linting results.

#### Example


```r
my_data <- read.csv("C:/Users/me/Documents/My R Scripts/Reproducible.csv")
```


The linting query can be used to run this rule on the above example:




```json
[ { "type": "linter",   "rules": [ { "name": "file-path-validity",     "config": {} } ] } ]
```




_Results (prettified and summarized):_

Query: **linter** (9 ms)\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;╰ file-path-validity:\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;╰ definitely:\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;╰ Path `C:/Users/me/Documents/My R Scripts/Reproducible.csv` at 2.12-74\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;╰ _Metadata_: <code>{"totalReads":1,"totalUnknown":0,"totalWritesBeforeAlways":0,"totalValid":0,"searchTimeMs":8,"processTimeMs":1}</code>\
_All queries together required ≈9 ms (1ms accuracy, total 14 ms)_

<details> <summary style="color:gray">Show Detailed Results as Json</summary>

The analysis required _13.7 ms_ (including parsing and normalization and the query) within the generation environment.	

In general, the JSON contains the Ids of the nodes in question as they are present in the normalized AST or the dataflow graph of flowR.
