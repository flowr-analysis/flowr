_This document was generated from '[src/documentation/print-linter-wiki.ts](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/documentation/print-linter-wiki.ts)' on 2025-06-15, 13:26:00 UTC presenting an overview of flowR's linter (v2.2.15, using R v4.5.0). Please do not edit this file/wiki page directly._

This page describes the flowR linter, which is a tool that utilizes flowR's dataflow analysis to find common issues in R scripts. The linter can currently be used through the linter [query](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Query%20API).
For example:



```shell
$ docker run -it --rm eagleoutice/flowr # or npm run flowr 
flowR repl using flowR v2.2.15, R v4.5.0 (r-shell engine)
R> :query @linter "read.csv(\"/root/x.txt\")"
```

The linter will analyze the code and return any issues found.
Formatted more nicely, this returns:




```json
[ { "type": "linter" } ]
```

<h2 id="linting-rules">Linting Rules</h2>

The following linting rules are available:

<h3 id="deprecated-functions">Deprecated Functions (<code>deprecated-functions</code>)</h3>
	
<span title="This rule is used to detect issues that do not directly affect the semantics of the code, but are still considered bad practice."><a href='#smell'>![smell](https://img.shields.io/badge/smell-yellow) </a></span> <span title="This signals the use of deprecated functions or features."><a href='#deprecated'>![deprecated](https://img.shields.io/badge/deprecated-teal) </a></span> <span title="This rule is used to detect issues that are related to the reproducibility of the code.

Marks deprecated functions that should not be used anymore.

<details>

#### Configuration

Linting rules can be configured by passing a configuration object to the linter query as shown in the example below. The `deprecated-functions` rule accepts the following configuration options:

- [<code><span title="The list of function names that should be marked as deprecated.">deprecatedFunctions</span></code>](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/linter/rules/deprecated-functions.ts#L20)\
The list of function names that should be marked as deprecated.

#### Example


```r
first <- data.frame(x = c(1, 2, 3), y = c(1, 2, 3))
second <- data.frame(x = c(1, 3, 2), y = c(1, 3, 2))
dplyr::all_equal(first, second)
```


The linting query can be used to run this rule on the above example:




```json
[ { "type": "linter",   "rules": [ { "name": "deprecated-functions",     "config": {} } ] } ]
```




_Results (prettified and summarized):_

Query: **linter** (0â€‰ms)\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;â•° deprecated-functions:\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;â•° _Metadata_: <code>{"totalRelevant":9,"totalNotDeprecated":9,"searchTimeMs":0,"processTimeMs":0}</code>\
_All queries together required â‰ˆ0â€‰ms (1ms accuracy, total 5â€‰ms)_

<details> <summary style="color:gray">Show Detailed Results as Json</summary>

The analysis required _4.6â€‰ms_ (including parsing and normalization and the query) within the generation environment.	

In general, the JSON contains the Ids of the nodes in question as they are present in the normalized AST or the dataflow graph of flowR.
Please consult the [Interface](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Interface) wiki page for more information on how to get those.

The set of functions that should additionally be considered as reading a file path.
Entries in this array use the
<code>FunctionInfo</code>
format from the dependencies query.
- [<code><span title="The set of functions that should additionally be considered as writing to a file path. Entries in this array use the FunctionInfo format from the dependencies query.">additionalWriteFunctions</span></code>](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/linter/rules/file-path-validity.ts#L38)\
The set of functions that should additionally be considered as writing to a file path.

Whether unknown file paths should be included as linting results.

#### Example


```r
my_data <- read.csv("C:/Users/me/Documents/My R Scripts/Reproducible.csv")

The linting query can be used to run this rule on the above example:




```json
[ { "type": "linter",   "rules": [ { "name": "file-path-validity",     "config": {} } ] } ]
