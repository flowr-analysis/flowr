_This document was generated from '[src/documentation/print-linter-wiki.ts](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/documentation/print-linter-wiki.ts)' on 2025-07-03, 06:35:51 UTC presenting an overview of flowR's linter (v2.2.15, using R v4.5.0). Please do not edit this file/wiki page directly._

This page describes the flowR linter, which is a tool that utilizes flowR's dataflow analysis to find common issues in R scripts. The linter can currently be used through the linter [query](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Query%20API).
For example:



```shell
$ docker run -it --rm eagleoutice/flowr # or npm run flowr 
flowR repl using flowR v2.2.15, R v4.5.0 (r-shell engine)
R> :query @linter "read.csv(\"/root/x.txt\")"
```

The linter will analyze the code and return any issues found.
Formatted more nicely, this returns:




```json
[ { "type": "linter" } ]
```

The analysis required _17.5â€‰ms_ (including parsing and normalization and the query) within the generation environment.	

In general, the JSON contains the Ids of the nodes in question as they are present in the normalized AST or the dataflow graph of flowR.
Please consult the [Interface](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Interface) wiki page for more information on how to get those.

<h2 id="linting-rules">Linting Rules</h2>

The following linting rules are available:



**[Absolute Paths](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/lint-absolute-file-paths):** Checks whether file paths are absolute. [see <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/linter/rules/absolute-path.ts#L116">src/linter/rules/absolute-path.ts</a>]\

**[Deprecated Functions](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/lint-deprecated-functions):** Marks deprecated functions that should not be used anymore.
