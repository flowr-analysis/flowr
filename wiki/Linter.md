_This document was generated from '[src/documentation/print-linter-wiki.ts](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/documentation/print-linter-wiki.ts)' on 2025-10-21, 13:24:25 UTC presenting an overview of flowR's linter (v2.6.1, using R v4.5.0). Please do not edit this file/wiki page directly._

This page describes the flowR linter, which is a tool that utilizes flowR's dataflow analysis to find common issues in R scripts. The linter can currently be used through the linter [query](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Query%20API).
For example:



```shell
$ docker run -it --rm eagleoutice/flowr # or npm run flowr 
flowR repl using flowR v2.6.1, R v4.5.0 (r-shell engine)
R> :query @linter "read.csv(\"/root/x.txt\")"
```

The linter will analyze the code and return any issues found.
Formatted more nicely, this returns:




```json
[ { "type": "linter" } ]
```


(This query can be shortened to `@linter` when used within the REPL command <span title="Description (Repl Command): Query the given R code, start with 'file://' to indicate a file. The query is to be a valid query in json format (use 'help' to get more information).">`:query`</span>).

The analysis required _28.5â€‰ms_ (including parsing and normalization and the query) within the generation environment.	

In general, the JSON contains the Ids of the nodes in question as they are present in the normalized AST or the dataflow graph of flowR.
Please consult the [Interface](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Interface) wiki page for more information on how to get those.

<h2 id="certainty">Certainty</h2>

Both linting rules and their individual results are additionally categorized by how certain the linter is that the results it is returning are valid.

<h3 id="rule-certainty">Rule Certainty</h3>

| Rule Certainty | Description |
| -------------- | :---------- |
| <a id="exact"></a> `exact` | Linting rules that are expected to have both high precision and high recall. (rules: _none_) |
| <a id="best-effort"></a> `best-effort` | Linting rules that are expected to have high precision, but not necessarily high recall. Rules with this certainty generally ensure that the results they return are correct, but may not return all results.

| <a id="over-approximative"></a> `over-approximative` | Linting rules that are expected to have high recall, but not necessarily high precision. Rules with this certainty generally return all relevant results, but may also include some incorrect matches. (rule: [naming-convention](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/lint-naming-convention)) |
	
<h3 id="result-certainty">Result Certainty</h3>

| Result Certainty | Description |
| ---------------- | :---------- |
| <a id="uncertain"></a> `uncertain` | The linting rule cannot say for sure whether the result is correct or not. This linting certainty should be used for linting results whose calculations are based on estimations involving unknown side-effects, reflection, etc. |
| <a id="certain"></a> `certain` | The linting rule is certain that the reported lint is real. This linting certainty should be used for linting results whose calculations do not involve estimates or other unknown factors. |
