_This document was generated from '[src/documentation/print-linter-wiki.ts](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/documentation/print-linter-wiki.ts)' on 2025-06-22, 14:11:41 UTC presenting an overview of flowR's linter (v2.2.15, using R v4.5.0). Please do not edit this file/wiki page directly._

This page describes the flowR linter, which is a tool that utilizes flowR's dataflow analysis to find common issues in R scripts. The linter can currently be used through the linter [query](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Query%20API).
For example:



```shell
$ docker run -it --rm eagleoutice/flowr # or npm run flowr 
flowR repl using flowR v2.2.15, R v4.5.0 (r-shell engine)
R> :query @linter "read.csv(\"/root/x.txt\")"
```

```



The linter will analyze the code and return any issues found.
Formatted more nicely, this returns:




```json
[ { "type": "linter" } ]
```

Linting rules can be configured by passing a configuration object to the linter query as shown in the example below. The `absolute-file-paths` rule accepts the following configuration options:

- <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/linter/rules/absolute-path.ts#L46"><code><span title="Extend the built-in absolute path recognition with additional regexes">absolutePathRegex</span></code></a>\

- <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/linter/rules/absolute-path.ts#L51"><code><span title="The set of functions that should additionally be considered as using a file path. Entries in this array use the FunctionInfo format from the dependencies query.">additionalPathFunctions</span></code></a>\

Include paths that are built by functions, e.g., `file.path()`
- <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/linter/rules/absolute-path.ts#L56"><code><span title="Which path should be considered to be the origin for relative paths. This is only relevant with quickfixes. In the future we may be sensitive to setwd etc.">useAsWd</span></code></a>\
Which path should be considered to be the origin for relative paths.
This is only relevant with quickfixes. In the future we may be sensitive to setwd etc.

#### Example


```r

```


The linting query can be used to run this rule on the above example:




```json
[ { "type": "linter",   "rules": [ { "name": "absolute-file-paths",     "config": {} } ] } ]
```

Checks for unused definitions.\
_Implemented in <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/linter/rules/unused-definition.ts#L95">src/linter/rules/unused-definition.ts</a>_
 
<details>

#### Configuration

Linting rules can be configured by passing a configuration object to the linter query as shown in the example below. The `unused-definitions` rule accepts the following configuration options:

- <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/linter/rules/unused-definition.ts#L28"><code><span title="Whether to include (potentially anonymous) function definitions in the search (e.g., should we report uncalled anonymous functions?).">includeFunctionDefinitions</span></code></a>\
Whether to include (potentially anonymous) function definitions in the search (e.g., should we report uncalled anonymous functions?).

#### Example


```r
x <- 42
y <- 3
print(x)
```


The linting query can be used to run this rule on the above example:




```json
[ { "type": "linter",   "rules": [ { "name": "unused-definitions",     "config": {} } ] } ]
```




_Results (prettified and summarized):_

Query: **linter** (0 ms)\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;╰ unused-definitions:\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;╰ maybe:\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;╰ Definition of `y` at 3.1 (quick fix available)\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;╰ _Metadata_: <code>{"totalConsidered":2,"searchTimeMs":0,"processTimeMs":0}</code>\
_All queries together required ≈0 ms (1ms accuracy, total 2 ms)_

<details> <summary style="color:gray">Show Detailed Results as Json</summary>

The analysis required _1.6 ms_ (including parsing and normalization and the query) within the generation environment.
