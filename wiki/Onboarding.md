Please do not edit this file/wiki page directly._	
	
To get started developing on *flowR*, we recommend carefully reading the following pages:
- ðŸ’» [Setting up the *flowR* development environment](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Setup#%EF%B8%8F-building-from-scratch).  This page explains how to install **R** and **Node.js**.  
- ðŸ’– [Contributing guidelines](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).  This page also includes information about how to set up **git-lfs** and several **git hooks**.

## âŒ› TL;DR

The most important steps to get the *flowR* development environment set up (after installing **R** and **Node.js**) can be seen below. For convenience, they can be executed all at once using the following command:

```shell
npm run setup:dev
```


If you want to execute the steps manually, please follow the instructions below:


```shell
# Installing git-lfs for your current user (if you haven't already)
git lfs install
# Cloning the repository
git clone https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr.git
# Installing dependencies
npm ci
# Configuring git hooks
git config --local core.hooksPath .githooks/
# Test if the git hooks are working correctly
# Running this command should lint the code
git push --dry-run
```
