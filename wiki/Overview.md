This page focuses on the features presented by _flowR_ and how to use them.
If you have never used _flowR_ before, please refer to the [setup](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Setup) wiki page first, for instructions on how to install _flowR_.

The [mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) diagram above presents the architecture of _flowR_,
with the important components directly related to the analysis highlighted accordingly.

Primarily, _flowR_ provides a backward [program slicer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_slicing) for the [*R*](https://www.r-project.org/) programming language, which is available with the corresponding [slicer](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main/src/slicing) module and exposed by the [`slicer`](#generate-static-slices) script.
Its subcomponents (like the custom [R bridge](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main/src/r-bridge) or the static [dataflow analysis]("https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main/src/dataflow)) are not important if you simply wish to use _flowR_.

The benchmark module is only of interest if you want to benchmark/measure the runtime performance and reduction of the slicer. It is available with the [`benchmark`](#benchmark-the-slicer) script.

The statistics module is mostly independent of the slicer and can be used to analyze R files regarding their use of function definitions, assignments, and more.  It is used to identify common patterns in R code and is available with the [`statistics`](#generate-usage-statistics-of-r-code) script.

The [core](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main/src/core) module contains _flowR_'s read-eval-print loop (REPL) and _flowR_'s server. Furthermore, it contains the root definitions of how _flowR_ slices (see the [interface](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Interface) wiki page for more information).

The [utility](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main/src/util) module is of no further interest for the usage of _flowR_

The following sections explain how to use these features.

## Using _flowR_

_flowR_ itself has two main ways to operate:

- as a **server** which processes analysis and slicing requests (`--server` option)
- as a **read-eval-print loop** (REPL) that can be accessed directly from the command line (default option)

Besides these two ways, there is a [Visual Studio Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=code-inspect.vscode-flowr) that allows you to use _flowR_ directly from within the editor (it is available on [open-vsx](https://open-vsx.org/extension/code-inspect/vscode-flowr) as well).
Similarly, we offer an [Addin for RStudio](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/rstudio-addin-flowr), as well as an [R package](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr-r-adapter).

🐳️ If you use the docker-version, simply starting the docker container in interactive mode drops you right into the REPL (`docker run -it --rm eagleoutice/flowr:latest`), while launching with the `--server` argument starts the server (`docker run -it --rm eagleoutice/flowr:latest --server`).\
⚒️ If you compile the _flowR_ sources yourself, you can access _flowR_ by first building the sources (`npm run build`) and executing then the root script (`node dist/src/flowr.js`).

Independent of your way of launching *flowr*, we will write simply `flowr` for either (🐳️)&nbsp;`docker run -it --rm eagleoutice/flowr:latest` or (⚒️)&nbsp;`node dist/src/flowr.js`. See the [setup](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Setup) wiki page for more information on how to get _flowR_ running.

### The Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL)

Once you launched _flowR_, you should see a small&nbsp;`R>` prompt. Use `:help` to receive instructions on how to use the REPL and what features are available (most prominently, you can access all [scripts](#calling-the-scripts-directly) simply by adding a colon before them).
In general, all commands start with a colon (`:`), everything else is interpreted as a&nbsp;R expression which is directly evaluated by the underlying R shell (however, due to security concerns, you need to start _flowR_ with `--r-session-access` and use the `r-shell` engine to allow this). The following GIF showcases a simple example session:

### The Server

Instead of the REPL, you can start _flowR_ in "([TCP](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol)) server-mode" using `flowr --server` (write `flowr --help` to find out more). Together with the server option, you can configure the port with `--port`.
The supported requests are documented alongside the internal documentation, see the [Interface](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Interface) wiki page for more information.

The server allows accessing the REPL as well
(see the [interface](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Interface) wiki page for more information).

## Calling the Scripts Directly

This describes the old way of using _flowR_ by creating and calling the respective scripts directly. Although this is no longer necessary, the scripts still remain, fully integrated into the REPL of _flowR_ (you can access them simply by adding a colon `:` before the name).

### Generate Static Slices

To generate a slice, you need to provide two things:

1. A [slicing criterion](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Terminology#slicing-criterion): the location of a single variable or several variables of interest to slice for, like "`12@product`"
2. The path to an R&nbsp;file that should be sliced.

For example, from the `cli` directory, you can run

```shell
npm run slicer -- --criterion "12@product" "test/testfiles/example.R"
```

This slices for the first use of the variable `product` in line&nbsp;12 of the source file at `test/testfiles/example.R` (see the [slicing criterion](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Terminology#slicing-criterion) definition for more information).
By default, the resulting slice is output to the standard output.

For more options, run the following from the `cli` directory:

```shell
npm run slicer -- --help
```

Now, the following alternative is to be preferred:

```shell
flowr -e ":slicer --help"
```

### Benchmark the Slicer

Within the original [thesis](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Thesis), I conducted a benchmark of the slicer, measuring:

1. The required time of each step of the slicing process, and
2. The achieved reductions in the size of the slice.

The corresponding _benchmark_ script ultimately allows doing the same thing as the _slicing_ script, but 1) parallel for many files and 2) for a wider selection of slicing points.
By default, it starts by collecting all variables in a script, producing a slice for each of them.

For example, to run the benchmark on 500 randomly picked files of the folder `<folder>` using 8 threads and writing the output to `<output.json>`, you can run this from the `cli` directory:

```shell
npm run benchmark -- --limit 500 --parallel 8 --output "<output.json>" "<folder>"
```

For more options, run the following from the `cli` directory:

```shell
npm run benchmark -- --help
```

#### Summarizing the Benchmark Results

The resulting JSON file can be rather larger (starting off with a couple of hundred megabytes). Therefore, you probably want to summarize the results of the benchmark.
For this, you can make use of the _summarizer_ script from within the `cli` directory like this:

```shell
npm run summarizer -- "<output.json>"
```

Please note that the summarizer may require a long time as it parses, normalizes, and analyzes _each_ slice produced, to calculate the reduction numbers. Therefore, it actually executes two steps:

1. For each file, it calculates the reduction, required time, and other information, written to `<output-summary.json>`
2. Calculate the "ultimate" summary by aggregating the intermediate results for each file

As the ultimate summary is much quicker, you can re-run it by specifically adding the `--ultimate-only` flag (although this is only really of use if you modify what should be summarized within the source code of _flowR_).

For more options, run the following from the `cli` directory:

```shell
npm run summarizer -- --help
```

### Generate Usage Statistics of R Code

If you want to reproduce the statistics as presented in the original [master's thesis](http://dx.doi.org/10.18725/OPARU-50107), see the corresponding [wiki page](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Thesis#how-to-reproduce-the-statistics-from-the-masters-thesis).

For more information, run the following from the `cli` directory:

```shell
npm run stats -- --help
```

### Export RDF N-Quads

If you know what the RDF N-Quads refer to, then you are good to go! If not, you do not have to worry - you probably do not need them (they are for a graph search that is based on _flowR_).

For more information, run the following from the `cli` directory:

```shell
npm run export-quads -- --help
```
