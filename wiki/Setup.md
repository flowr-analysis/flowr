There are several ways to use _flowR_.
You can download and build it from source, download the accompanying docker image, or use its Visual Studio Code extension and RStudio Addin.

If you want to develop for _flowR_, you want to see how to [build from scratch](#-building-from-scratch) and have a look at the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## üóíÔ∏è Using the Visual Studio Code Extension

The easiest way to use _flowR_ is to install the [Visual Studio Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=code-inspect.vscode-flowr).
The extension directly includes a version of _flowR_ that can be used by default, so you can start analyzing code right away (given that you have R installed on your system).
Please check out the marketplace entry for more information.

## üóíÔ∏è Using the RStudio Addin

You can also use _flowR_ as an RStudio Addin. Please check out the [RStudio Addin repository](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/rstudio-addin-flowr) for more information on how to get started!

## üê≥Ô∏è Using the Docker Image

You can get the image from [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/eagleoutice/flowr) by running:

```shell
docker pull eagleoutice/flowr
```

Afterward, you can test if the installation was successful by running the following (currently, there is no helper script for that):

```shell
docker run -it --rm eagleoutice/flowr
```

This should drop you into _flowR_'s read-evaluate-print loop.
Enter `:help` to receive more information and `:quit` to leave.
Please remember that you have to link external directories to make them available within the running container.

To start flowr as a server, you can run:

```shell
docker run -it --rm -p1042:1042 eagleoutice/flowr --server
```

For more information, see the [Interface](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Interface) wiki page.

## ‚öíÔ∏è Building From Scratch

To use _flowR_, you may need [_R_](https://www.r-project.org/) installed and on your path
(this only affects the [`r-shell` engine][r-shell]).

### Installing R
Although there are several ways to do so, there is nothing wrong with installing&nbsp;R with the help of your favorite package manager or directly from the [website](https://cloud.r-project.org/).<a href="#note1" id="note1ref"><sup>&lt;1&gt;</sup></a>
For ü™ü&nbsp;Windows, see [here](https://www.hanss.info/sebastian/post/rtools-path/) for an explanation on how to add [_R_](https://www.r-project.org/) to your path variable.
Again, you only require this for the [`r-shell` engine][r-shell].

### Installing Node.js

Furthermore, you need the [node package manager](https://www.npmjs.com/) (for Linux, we recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)).

### Installing _flowR_

After cloning the repository,<a href="#note2" id="note2ref"><sup>&lt;2&gt;</sup></a> you can install the dependencies with:

```shell
npm i
```

After that, you should be fine! You may test _flowR_'s command-line interface by running the following from the `cli` directory:

```shell
npm run slicer -- --criterion "12@product" test/testfiles/example.R
```

The output should look similar to this:

```R
product <- 1
N <- 10
for(i in 1:(N-1)) product <- product * i
cat("Product:", product, "\n")
```

At the time of writing this, there is currently no page for frequently encountered errors. So just [message me](mailto:florian.sihler@uni-ulm.de) in case of problems.

-----
<a id="note1" href="#note1ref">&lt;1&gt;</a>: Currently, _flowR_ is only tested with R versions `4.x` and `3.6.x`.

<a id="note2" href="#note2ref">&lt;2&gt;</a>: We use
[git-lfs](https://git-lfs.com/) to store larger files, especially for the wiki pages. So if you want to work on these parts, make sure to have it set-up (see the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) in the repository for more information).
