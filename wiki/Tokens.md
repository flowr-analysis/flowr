Based on the collection of tokens that we know can be emitted by R, this page is almost a verbatim copy of the corresponding section of the appendix in the original [master's thesis](http://dx.doi.org/10.18725/OPARU-50107).

Every R&nbsp;program is an expression list, identified by the `exprlist` token type, which consists of several expressions (identified by `expr`).
Consider the following example:

```R
x <- 1 + 2
if(x > 0) {
    print("Hello World!")
}
y <- 3
```

The corresponding *expression list* consists of three expressions, namely the assignment of&nbsp;`1 + 2` to&nbsp;`x`, the&nbsp;`if` construct, and the assignment of&nbsp;`3` to&nbsp;`y`.

With the following tables, we provide what is to our knowledge a full list of token types that R&nbsp;produces.
For more information, the ["Syntax" topic](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/Syntax) of the R&nbsp;documentation offers a great starting point.

Besides `PIPEBIND`, which at the moment must be enabled explicitly by setting an [environment variable](https://github.com/REditorSupport/languageserver/issues/432) all the tokens shown in the tables are supported by the normalization of *flowR* - although this is different from supporting all of their uses.

It should be noted that there are many tokens that appear in the source code of the R&nbsp;interpreter but are not listed within the tables.
While some of these tokens, like `COLON_ASSIGN`, are explicitly marked as deprecated, several of them seem to be for internal use only and are - to the best of our knowledge - never emitted by the parser with [`getParseData`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/versions/3.6.2/topics/getParseData). For example:

- newlines are directly consumed to split expressions,
- error tokens produce an explicit error message, and
- the individual tokens for unary operators (like `UPLUS`) are transformed to the same token as their binary counterparts (like&nbsp;`+`).
