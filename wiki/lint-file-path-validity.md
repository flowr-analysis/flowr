<span title="This rule is used to detect bugs in the code. Everything that affects the semantics of the code, such as incorrect function calls, wrong arguments, etc. is to be considered a bug. Otherwise, it may be a smell or a style issue."><a href='#bug'>![bug](https://img.shields.io/badge/bug-red) </a></span> <span title="This rule is used to detect issues that are related to the reproducibility of the code. For example, missing or incorrect random seeds, or missing data."><a href='#reproducibility'>![reproducibility](https://img.shields.io/badge/reproducibility-teal) </a></span> <span title="This rule is used to detect issues that are related to the portability of the code.

This rule is a `best-effort` rule.
 
Checks whether file paths used in read and write operations are valid and point to existing files.\
_This linting rule is implemented in <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/linter/rules/file-path-validity.ts#L49">src/linter/rules/file-path-validity.ts</a>._


### Configuration

Linting rules can be configured by passing a configuration object to the linter query as shown in the example below.
The `file-path-validity` rule accepts the following configuration options:

- <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/linter/rules/file-path-validity.ts#L30"><code><span title="The set of functions that should additionally be considered as reading a file path. Entries in this array use the FunctionInfo format from the dependencies query.">additionalReadFunctions</span></code></a>\
The set of functions that should additionally be considered as reading a file path.
Entries in this array use the
<code>FunctionInfo</code>
format from the dependencies query.
- <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/linter/rules/file-path-validity.ts#L35"><code><span title="The set of functions that should additionally be considered as writing to a file path. Entries in this array use the FunctionInfo format from the dependencies query.">additionalWriteFunctions</span></code></a>\
The set of functions that should additionally be considered as writing to a file path.
Entries in this array use the
<code>FunctionInfo</code>
format from the dependencies query.
- <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/linter/rules/file-path-validity.ts#L39"><code><span title="Whether unknown file paths should be included as linting results.">includeUnknown</span></code></a>\
Whether unknown file paths should be included as linting results.

### Examples


```r
my_data <- read.csv("C:/Users/me/Documents/My R Scripts/Reproducible.csv")
```


The linting query can be used to run this rule on the above example:




```json
[ { "type": "linter",   "rules": [ { "name": "file-path-validity",     "config": {} } ] } ]
```

The analysis required _7.4 ms_ (including parsing and normalization and the query) within the generation environment.	

In general, the JSON contains the Ids of the nodes in question as they are present in the normalized AST or the dataflow graph of flowR.
Please consult the [Interface](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Interface) wiki page for more information on how to get those.

#### Additional Examples
	
These examples are synthesized from the test cases in: [test/functionality/linter/lint-file-path-validity.test.ts](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//test/functionality/linter/lint-file-path-validity.test.ts)


<h4 id="Test_Case:_none">Test Case: none</h4>

> As the script contains no file paths, we expect no issues

Given the following input:

```r
cat("hello")
```



We expect the linter to report the following:

```ts
* no lints
```


See [here](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//test/functionality/linter/lint-file-path-validity.test.ts#L17) for the test-case implementation.
		
<h4 id="Test_Case:_simple">Test Case: simple</h4>

> Assuming, that `file.csv` exists, we expect the linter to not report any issues, but to report an invalid file path for `file-missing.csv`

Given the following input:

```r
cat("hello")
read.csv("file.csv")
read.csv("file-missing.csv")
```



We expect the linter to report the following:

```ts
certainty: LintingResultCertainty.Certain, filePath: 'file-missing.csv', range: [3, 1, 3, 28]

<h4 id="Test_Case:_simple_ignore_case">Test Case: simple ignore case</h4>

> If we configure the linter to ignore capitalization, we expect the linter to not report an issue for `file.csv`, but still report an issue for `file-missing.csv`

Given the following input:

```r
cat("hello")
read.csv("FiLe.csv")

read.csv("path/to/deep-file.csv")
read.csv("path/to/deep-file-missing.csv")
