This rule is a `best-effort` rule.
 
Marks network functions that execute network operations, such as downloading files or making HTTP requests.\
_This linting rule is implemented in <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/linter/rules/network-functions.ts#L16">src/linter/rules/network-functions.ts</a>._


### Configuration

Linting rules can be configured by passing a configuration object to the linter query as shown in the example below.
The `network-functions` rule accepts the following configuration options:

- <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/linter/rules/network-functions.ts#L10"><code><span title="The list of function names that should be marked in the given context if their arguments match.">fns</span></code></a>\
The list of function names that should be marked in the given context if their arguments match.
- <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/linter/rules/network-functions.ts#L12"><code><span title="only trigger if the function's read argument is linked to a value that matches this pattern">onlyTriggerWithArgument</span></code></a>\
only trigger if the function's read argument is linked to a value that matches this pattern

### Examples


```r
read.csv("https://example.com/data.csv")
download.file("https://foo.bar")
```


The linting query can be used to run this rule on the above example:




```json
[ { "type": "linter",   "rules": [ { "name": "network-functions",     "config": {} } ] } ]
```






_Results (prettified and summarized):_

Query: **linter** (0 ms)\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;╰ **Network Functions** (network-functions):\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;╰ certain:\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;╰ Function `read.csv` at 2.1-40\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;╰ Function `download.file` at 3.1-32\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;╰ _Metadata_: <code>{"totalCalls":2,"totalFunctionDefinitions":2,"searchTimeMs":0,"processTimeMs":0}</code>\
_All queries together required ≈0 ms (1ms accuracy, total 2 ms)_

The analysis required _2.4 ms_ (including parsing and normalization and the query) within the generation environment.	

In general, the JSON contains the Ids of the nodes in question as they are present in the normalized AST or the dataflow graph of flowR.
Please consult the [Interface](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Interface) wiki page for more information on how to get those.

#### Additional Examples
	
These examples are synthesized from the test cases in: [test/functionality/linter/lint-network-functions.test.ts](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//test/functionality/linter/lint-network-functions.test.ts)


<h4 id="Test_Case:_network_function_nested">Test Case: network function nested</h4>

> Testing the nested use the 'url' function in other function calls

Given the following input:

```r
foo(url("http://example.com"))
```


And using the following [configuration](#configuration): 
```ts
{ fns: ['url'] }
```


We expect the linter to report the following:

```ts
certainty: LintingResultCertainty.Certain, function: 'url', range: [1,5,1,29]
```


See [here](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//test/functionality/linter/lint-network-functions.test.ts#L23) for the test-case implementation.
		
<h4 id="Test_Case:_do_not_trigger_without_url_prefix">Test Case: do not trigger without url prefix</h4>


Given the following input:

```r
read.csv("www.example.com")
```


And using the following [configuration](#configuration): 
```ts
{ fns: ['read.csv'] }
```


We expect the linter to report the following:

```ts
* no lints
```


See [here](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//test/functionality/linter/lint-network-functions.test.ts#L42) for the test-case implementation.
