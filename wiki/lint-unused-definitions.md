This rule is a `best-effort` rule.
 
Checks for unused definitions.\
_This linting rule is implemented in <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/linter/rules/unused-definition.ts#L96">src/linter/rules/unused-definition.ts</a>._


### Configuration

Linting rules can be configured by passing a configuration object to the linter query as shown in the example below.
The `unused-definitions` rule accepts the following configuration options:

- <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/linter/rules/unused-definition.ts#L29"><code><span title="Whether to include (potentially anonymous) function definitions in the search (e.g., should we report uncalled anonymous functions?).">includeFunctionDefinitions</span></code></a>\
Whether to include (potentially anonymous) function definitions in the search (e.g., should we report uncalled anonymous functions?).

### Examples


```r
x <- 42
y <- 3
print(x)
```


The linting query can be used to run this rule on the above example:




```json
[ { "type": "linter",   "rules": [ { "name": "unused-definitions",     "config": {} } ] } ]
```






_Results (prettified and summarized):_

Query: **linter** (1 ms)\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;╰ **Unused Definitions** (unused-definitions):\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;╰ uncertain:\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;╰ Definition of `y` at 3.1 (1 quick fix(es) available)\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;╰ _Metadata_: <code>{"totalConsidered":2,"searchTimeMs":0,"processTimeMs":1}</code>\
_All queries together required ≈1 ms (1ms accuracy, total 4 ms)_

<details> <summary style="color:gray">Show Detailed Results as Json</summary>

The analysis required _4.4 ms_ (including parsing and normalization and the query) within the generation environment.	

In general, the JSON contains the Ids of the nodes in question as they are present in the normalized AST or the dataflow graph of flowR.
Please consult the [Interface](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Interface) wiki page for more information on how to get those.
