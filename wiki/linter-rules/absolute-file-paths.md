Checks whether file paths are absolute.\
_This linting rule is implemented in <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/linter/rules/absolute-path.ts#L115">src/linter/rules/absolute-path.ts</a>._


#### Configuration

Linting rules can be configured by passing a configuration object to the linter query as shown in the example below.
The `absolute-file-paths` rule accepts the following configuration options:

- <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/linter/rules/absolute-path.ts#L46"><code><span title="Extend the built-in absolute path recognition with additional regexes">absolutePathRegex</span></code></a>\
Extend the built-in absolute path recognition with additional regexes
- <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/linter/rules/absolute-path.ts#L51"><code><span title="The set of functions that should additionally be considered as using a file path. Entries in this array use the FunctionInfo format from the dependencies query.">additionalPathFunctions</span></code></a>\
The set of functions that should additionally be considered as using a file path.
Entries in this array use the
<code>FunctionInfo</code>
format from the dependencies query.
- <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/linter/rules/absolute-path.ts#L39"><code><span title="Include paths that are built by functions, e.g., file.path()">include</span></code></a>\
Include paths that are built by functions, e.g., `file.path()`
- <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/linter/rules/absolute-path.ts#L56"><code><span title="Which path should be considered to be the origin for relative paths. This is only relevant with quickfixes. In the future we may be sensitive to setwd etc.">useAsWd</span></code></a>\
Which path should be considered to be the origin for relative paths.
This is only relevant with quickfixes. In the future we may be sensitive to setwd etc.

#### Example


```r
read.csv("C:/Users/me/Documents/My R Scripts/Reproducible.csv")
```


The linting query can be used to run this rule on the above example:




```json
[ { "type": "linter",   "rules": [ { "name": "absolute-file-paths",     "config": {} } ] } ]
```




_Results (prettified and summarized):_

Query: **linter** (1 ms)\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;╰ absolute-file-paths:\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;╰ definitely:\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;╰ Path `C:/Users/me/Documents/My R Scripts/Reproducible.csv` at 2.1-63\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;╰ _Metadata_: <code>{"totalConsidered":1,"totalUnknown":0,"searchTimeMs":1,"processTimeMs":0}</code>\
_All queries together required ≈1 ms (1ms accuracy, total 1 ms)_

<details> <summary style="color:gray">Show Detailed Results as Json</summary>

The analysis required _0.9 ms_ (including parsing and normalization and the query) within the generation environment.	

In general, the JSON contains the Ids of the nodes in question as they are present in the normalized AST or the dataflow graph of flowR.
