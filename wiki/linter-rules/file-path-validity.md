Checks whether file paths used in read and write operations are valid and point to existing files.\
_This linting rule is implemented in <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/linter/rules/file-path-validity.ts#L52">src/linter/rules/file-path-validity.ts</a>._


#### Configuration

Linting rules can be configured by passing a configuration object to the linter query as shown in the example below.
The `file-path-validity` rule accepts the following configuration options:

- <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/linter/rules/file-path-validity.ts#L33"><code><span title="The set of functions that should additionally be considered as reading a file path. Entries in this array use the FunctionInfo format from the dependencies query.">additionalReadFunctions</span></code></a>\
The set of functions that should additionally be considered as reading a file path.
Entries in this array use the
<code>FunctionInfo</code>
format from the dependencies query.
- <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/linter/rules/file-path-validity.ts#L38"><code><span title="The set of functions that should additionally be considered as writing to a file path. Entries in this array use the FunctionInfo format from the dependencies query.">additionalWriteFunctions</span></code></a>\
The set of functions that should additionally be considered as writing to a file path.
Entries in this array use the
<code>FunctionInfo</code>
format from the dependencies query.
- <a href="https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/tree/main//src/linter/rules/file-path-validity.ts#L42"><code><span title="Whether unknown file paths should be included as linting results.">includeUnknown</span></code></a>\
Whether unknown file paths should be included as linting results.

#### Example


```r
my_data <- read.csv("C:/Users/me/Documents/My R Scripts/Reproducible.csv")
```


The linting query can be used to run this rule on the above example:




```json
[ { "type": "linter",   "rules": [ { "name": "file-path-validity",     "config": {} } ] } ]
```




_Results (prettified and summarized):_

Query: **linter** (1 ms)\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;╰ file-path-validity:\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;╰ definitely:\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;╰ Path `C:/Users/me/Documents/My R Scripts/Reproducible.csv` at 2.12-74\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;╰ _Metadata_: <code>{"totalReads":1,"totalUnknown":0,"totalWritesBeforeAlways":0,"totalValid":0,"searchTimeMs":0,"processTimeMs":1}</code>\
_All queries together required ≈1 ms (1ms accuracy, total 2 ms)_

The analysis required _1.9 ms_ (including parsing and normalization and the query) within the generation environment.	

In general, the JSON contains the Ids of the nodes in question as they are present in the normalized AST or the dataflow graph of flowR.
Please consult the [Interface](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr/wiki/Interface) wiki page for more information on how to get those.
